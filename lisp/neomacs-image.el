;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides GPU-accelerated image display support for Neomacs.
;; 
;; Basic usage:
;;   (neomacs-image-show-file "/path/to/image.png")
;;
;; API functions:
;;   `neomacs-image-load' - Load an image from file, returns image ID
;;   `neomacs-image-size' - Get image dimensions as (width . height)
;;   `neomacs-image-free' - Free an image from cache
;;   `neomacs-image-floating' - Display image as floating layer
;;   `neomacs-image-floating-clear' - Remove floating image layer

;;; Computed SVG animation (Neomacs extension).

;; animated SVG is a static frame there and `image-multi-frame-p' returns
;; nil.  Neomacs can materialize the frames an SVG's SMIL timeline computes
;; and expose them exactly like a GIF's: `image-multi-frame-p' reports the
;; frame count and delay, `image-animate' walks them, `:index' selects one.
;; Because that changes observable behavior, it is strictly opt-in per
;; image spec.

distinct frames one loop materializes.

Individual image specs override this default through their own

modified in place rather than copied: the frames walked are the frames
the window shows.  The `:animation' property is added from
`neomacs-svg-animation' only when the spec does not carry its own.

materializable animation, so callers can fall back to a static display.
