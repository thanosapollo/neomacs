;; The GUI runtime loader loads common-win first; keep the dependency explicit
;; so loading this file directly has the same prerequisites.
(require 'term/common-win)
;; This is an implementation fragment, not a public feature: loading it must not
;; add a Neomacs-only symbol to `features'.  Reapplying its key defaults is
;; idempotent and also keeps direct source-loading robust outside a dumped image.

;; `define-minor-mode' is a MACRO, so `easy-mmode' is a compile-time
;; dependency and not a load-time one: a `:global t' mode without `:keymap'
;; expands to `defcustom' / `defun' / `add-minor-mode', all of which are
;; already in the dumped image.  No GNU `term/FOO-win.el' loads `easy-mmode'
;; -- `grep -c define-minor-mode' answers 0 for all eight of them, and the two
;; under `lisp/term/' that do have one (`tvi970.el:102', `vt100.el:41') are TTY
;; files that are never dumped -- so requiring it at load time made this file
;; the only window-system file in either editor that drags the library in.
;; `eval-when-compile' still evaluates its body when the file is loaded as
;; SOURCE, so the macro is available there too.  DIVERGENCES.md 194.

;;; NS modifier policy (issue #442).

;; GNU's macOS backend is AppKit, and it reads seven C variables at every
;; `keyDown:' to cook the window server's raw modifier flags
;; (`EV_MODIFIERS2', src/nsterm.m:397-425).  Neomacs renders through winit on
;; every platform, so this window-system file owns the Lisp surface, with
;; GNU's compiled-in defaults (nsterm.m:11568-11643).  The render thread
;; cooks the same arithmetic from a compiled policy; see
;; `neomacs-set-modifier-policy'.
;;
;; This file loads after the init file (the GUI runtime loader runs once
;; frames are being created), while GNU's ns-win.el loads in the dump, before
;; user init.  A user config that setq's the `mac-*' compatibility alias
;; before this file loads therefore carries its value across here, exactly as
;; GNU's dump-order load would have left it.
