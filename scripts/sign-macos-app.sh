Usage: scripts/sign-macos-app.sh PATH/TO/neomacs.app

Sign nested code first and then seal the outer application bundle.
Set MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY to a Developer ID Application identity for a
Gatekeeper-trusted release. Without it, builds receive an ad-hoc signature so
rewritten Apple-Silicon binaries remain executable, but users may need Apple's
per-app Open Anyway flow.

"Nested code" is Apple's definition, not "Mach-O": everything under
Contents/MacOS, Contents/Frameworks, Contents/Helpers and Contents/PlugIns is
sealed as nested code and needs its own signature, whatever its file type.

# Apple requires nested code to be signed before its containing bundle.  Avoid
# `codesign --deep` as a signing operation: each code object has an explicit
# signature and the final app signature seals that graph.
#
# The set of things that count as nested code is decided by codesign's default
# resource rules, not by file type.  The V2 rules
# (Security, OSX/libsecurity_codesigning/lib/bundlediskrep.cpp,
# BundleDiskRep::defaultResourceRules) carry
#
#   '^(Frameworks|SharedFrameworks|PlugIns|Plug-ins|XPCServices|Helpers|MacOS
#     |Library/(Automator|Spotlight|LoginItems))/' = {nested=#T, weight=10}
#
# and that pattern is applied with regexec (resources.cpp:426,437), i.e. as a
# search over the bundle-relative path, so it matches at ANY depth beneath
# those directories.  signer.cpp then routes every matching file through
# signNested, which throws errSecCSUnsigned -- "code object is not signed at
# all" -- for anything without a cdhash.  A `find -type f` filtered by
# is_macho therefore silently skips exactly the files that break the seal:
# our dump image, and any script or data file a vendoring step drops in.
#
# Symlinks are excluded on purpose: resources.cpp:221-236 strips the nested
# flag for them ("symlinks cannot ever be nested code"), and .DS_Store is
# omitted outright by a weight-2000 rule.
# Under a NESTED root every file is nested code and needs its own signature,
# including non-Mach-O ones such as the portable dump.
