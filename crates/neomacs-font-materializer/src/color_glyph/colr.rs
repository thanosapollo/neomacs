//! COLR paint-graph traversal (`ttf-parser`) and rasterization (`tiny-skia`).
//!
//! Traversal is deliberately split from rasterization: ttf-parser's `Painter`
//! callbacks are recorded into a flat step list in *font units*, then replayed
//! twice — once to measure the device-space bounds that size the bitmap, once
//! to paint.  Nothing in the traversal knows about pixels, so the recorded
//! steps stay a faithful, testable description of the paint graph.
//!
//! Spec rules implemented here rather than delegated:
//!
//! * A basic fill with no bounding ancestor (no `PaintGlyph` clip and no
//!   `ClipBox`) is unbounded, and must not render.
//! * A fill with no shape of its own paints the clip in force: a `ClipBox`
//!   alone (or an enclosing `PaintGlyph`) is what makes a bare fill bounded.
//! * The clip that is a fill's own geometry is not applied to that fill a
//!   second time; for a `PaintGlyph` the two are the same coverage field, and
//!   multiplying them would square every antialiased edge.
//! * Degenerate gradients paint nothing: a linear gradient whose axis
//!   collapses onto its rotation reference, identical radial circles, a sweep
//!   whose color line repeats around a single angle.
//! * A color line with a single offset is ill-formed for repeat/reflect and
//!   paints nothing.
//! * Gradient geometry and glyph outlines share one transform stack, so a
//!   transformed gradient is rasterized in the same space as its shape.
