;;; XPM named colors under a real frame. -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Runs identically under GNU Emacs and Neomacs on a window-system frame. GNU
;; resolves an XPM `c` value through the frame terminal's `defined_color_hook`
;; (src/image.c:6503-6511), and the same hook backs `color-values' -- so what
;; the editor says a name means and what an XPM carrying that name must render
;; as are one claim. This fixture paints one swatch per name and records the
;; editor's own `color-values' for it; the Rust side checks the rendered pixels
;; against both (issue #545).
;;
;; Its second half is issue #550: a key that resolves to *nothing* is painted by
;; a rule, and the rule reads the frame's foreground -- never the face the image
;; is displayed under, never the specification's `:foreground' (GNU
;; `src/image.c:6518' and `:6537-6538'). GNU keeps the frame's `foreground-color'
;; equal to the default face's foreground (`src/xfaces.c:4394-4404'), so the
;; frame foreground is set to a colour nothing else in the frame uses.
