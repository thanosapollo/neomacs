// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// In-flight signal payload rooting
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// GNU never needs this: `signal_or_quit` builds the `(SYMBOL . DATA)` pair and
// longjmps with it on the C stack, and `mark_stack` scans that stack
// conservatively, so the payload is a root for free the whole way out
// (src/eval.c `signal_or_quit`, src/alloc.c `mark_stack`).
//
// This collector is PRECISE — there is no conservative stack scan at all
// (`crates/neovm-core/src/tagged/CONCURRENT_GC.md`, "precise-rooting precondition")
// — and a signal does not longjmp here, it
// travels up the Rust stack as `Flow::Signal(Box<SignalData>)`. That journey
// is not quiet: every frame it passes runs `unbind_to`, which executes
// `unwind-protect` cleanups, buffer and binding restores, and (through
// `signal-hook-function` / `debug-on-error`) arbitrary Lisp. All of that
// allocates, and any allocation-bearing safe point may collect.
//
// Without a root the payload is unreachable at exactly that moment, so the
// collector reclaims it, and `condition-case` then binds a DANGLING cons to
// its variable. The damage surfaces arbitrarily far away and unrecognizably:
// a reclaimed cons's cdr holds `ConsCell::set_free_next`'s raw `*mut ConsCell`
// free-list link, whose low three bits are `TAG_SYMBOL`, so it decodes as a
// symbol with a garbage id (DIVERGENCES.md 161).
//
// The table is a Context-owned slot arena rather than the `SCRATCH_GC_ROOTS`
// stack because a signal's lifetime is NOT stack-shaped: it is cloned, boxed,
// stored in a resume target, and converted to and from `EvalError`, so roots
// are released in an order a truncating stack cannot express.
