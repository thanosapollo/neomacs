//! GNU's entry/exit debugger hooks: `debug-on-next-call` and `debug-on-exit`.
//!
//! These are one mechanism, not two.  `do_debug_on_call` (`src/eval.c:335-341`)
//! is four lines and it does *both* halves:
//!
//! ```c
//! void
//! do_debug_on_call (Lisp_Object code, specpdl_ref count)
//! {
//!   debug_on_next_call = 0;                                     /* 338 */
//!   set_backtrace_debug_on_exit (specpdl_ref_to_ptr (count), true); /* 339 */
//!   call_debugger (list1 (code));                               /* 340 */
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Line 338 is the whole reason `debug-on-next-call` cannot be probed by
//! assignment: **setting it non-nil ARMS the debugger, and entering the
//! debugger CLEARS it again**, so the value a program reads back is `nil`
//! whenever a call intervened.  Line 339 is `debug-on-exit`: the frame that
//! the entry debugger fired on is also flagged to fire again on the way out.
//!
//! # Where GNU tests the arm
//!
//! Exactly three dispatch sites, and all three test it immediately after
//! `record_in_backtrace` so that line 339 has a frame to flag:
//!
//! | site | GNU | `code` |
//! |------|-----|--------|
//! | `eval_sub` | `src/eval.c:2601-2602` | `Qt` |
//! | `Ffuncall` | `src/eval.c:3189-3190` | `Qlambda` |
//! | `exec_byte_code`, `Bcall` | `src/bytecode.c:798-799` | `Qlambda` |
//!
//! `Fapply` has no check of its own: `apply1`/`Fapply` funnel into `Ffuncall`
//! (`src/eval.c:3192`), so `apply` is armed by the funcall site.  GNU's inline
//! bytecode opcodes (`Bcar`, `Bpoint`, … `bytecode.c:1412-1545`) are *not*
//! `Bcall` and are deliberately not gated -- which is why this port arms
//! `Op::Call` only, and never `Op::CallBuiltin`/`Op::CallBuiltinSym`.
//!
//! # Who else clears it
//!
//! `call_debugger` clears it a second time on entry (`src/eval.c:298`), and
//! `init_eval` clears it at startup (`src/eval.c:248`).  Nothing clears it on
//! the way *out* of a call: it is a one-shot that is spent the moment it is
//! observed.
//!
//! # The bad state, and why it is not spellable here
//!
//! An armed debugger that is still armed after the call it armed is the bad
//! state: the next call would enter the debugger again, and the next, forever.
//! GNU avoids it with an ordering convention -- clear first, then act.  A
//! convention is checkable, not enforceable, so this port makes the ordering
//! the *constructor*:
//!
//! * [`DebugOnCallArm`] has private fields and exactly one constructor,
//!   [`Context::take_debug_on_call_arm`], which performs the disarm before it
//!   returns the token.
//! * The token has exactly one consumer, [`Context::do_debug_on_call`], which
//!   takes it **by value**.
//! * There is no way to ask "is it armed?" that yields anything spendable:
//!   [`Context::debug_on_next_call_is_armed`] returns a bare `bool` and is only
//!   good for routing a call off a fast path.
//!
//! So "observed the arm but left it set" and "entered the debugger without
//! disarming" are both unconstructible rather than merely untested, and the
//! frame that line 339 flags is captured by the constructor from the specpdl
//! top rather than passed in -- GNU's `count` is always the frame
//! `record_in_backtrace` just returned, so "flagged the wrong frame" stops
//! being expressible too.
