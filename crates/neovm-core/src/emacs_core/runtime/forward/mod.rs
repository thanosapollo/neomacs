//! Forwarder descriptors for `SYMBOL_FORWARDED` symbols.
//!
//! Mirrors GNU Emacs's `Lisp_Fwd` family in `src/lisp.h:3060-3145`. A
//! forwarded symbol stores a pointer to a static [`LispFwd`] descriptor;
//! reads and writes go through the descriptor instead of touching the
//! symbol's value cell directly. This is how variables like
//! `buffer-file-name`, `point`, `mark-active`, and `case-fold-search`
//! get their backing storage in dedicated C-side slots.
//!
//! # What a forward type enforces
//!
//! The reason GNU routes assignment through the descriptor is not only
//! *where* the bytes land: each `Lisp_Fwd` variant also decides what the slot
//! will accept, and `store_symval_forwarding` (`src/data.c:1469-1530`) applies
//! that decision once, below every assignment path, so `Fset`, `set_default`,
//! `specbind` and the bytecode `varset` cannot each forget it.  The four rules
//! are genuinely different and do not generalise from one another:
//!
//! | variant             | rule at assignment                                     |
//! |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `Lisp_Fwd_Int`      | `CHECK_INTEGER`, then `integer_to_intmax` or `overflow-error` (`data.c:1475-1483`) |
//! | `Lisp_Fwd_Bool`     | no signal at all — coerces to `!NILP (newval)` (`data.c:1485-1487`) |
//! | `Lisp_Fwd_Obj`      | anything (`data.c:1489-1516`)                           |
//! | `Lisp_Fwd_Buffer_Obj` | the slot's closed predicate, bypassed for `nil` (`data.c:1518-1526`) |
//! | `Lisp_Fwd_Kboard_Obj` | anything (`data.c:1529-1536`)                         |
//!
//! [`LispFwd::store`] is that switch.  It is the only way to produce a
//! [`ForwardStore`], and a [`ForwardStore`] is the only thing the storage
//! setters accept, so a caller cannot reach a forwarded slot with a value the
//! forward type has not seen.
//!
//! # Implementation status
//!
//! All five variants are wired.  `Int` (GNU's `Lisp_Intfwd`), `Bool`
//! (`Lisp_Boolfwd`) and `BufferObj` (`Lisp_Buffer_Objfwd`) were wired by
//! ledger entries 132 and the Phase 8/10 work; `Obj` (`Lisp_Objfwd`) and
//! `KboardObj` (`Lisp_Kboard_Objfwd`) by ledger 170.
//!
//! # What being `SYMBOL_FORWARDED` costs beyond the store rule
//!
//! The table above is not the whole of the difference, and entry 132's
//! conclusion that `Lisp_Fwd_Obj` "enforces nothing, so no divergence
//! follows" was wrong by 447 names (measured by entry 168, re-derived by
//! entry 170).  GNU's redirect switch reaches three refusals BEFORE it ever
//! looks at what the descriptor points to:
//!
//! - `set_internal` refuses an unbind: `error ("Built-in variable may not be
//!   unbound : %s")` (`src/data.c:1802-1809`), and the localized twin at
//!   `src/data.c:1723-1727`, which keys on the mere presence of `blv->fwd`.
//!   There is no "unbound" bit pattern in a C slot.
//! - `Fdefvaralias` refuses the symbol as a NEW-ALIAS: `error ("Cannot make a
//!   built-in variable an alias: %s")` (`src/eval.c:665-668`).
//! - For `Lisp_Fwd_Kboard_Obj` only, `Fmake_variable_buffer_local` and
//!   `Fmake_local_variable` refuse it -- `error ("Symbol %s may not be
//!   buffer-local")` (`src/data.c:2220-2223`, `src/data.c:2286-2288`) -- and
//!   `variable-binding-locus` answers the terminal (`src/data.c:2519-2521`).
//!
//! Every one keys on the symbol's redirect TAG, which is why entry 170's fix
//! is the tag and the storage is only what the tag costs: a symbol's value
//! cell is one word, so once it holds the descriptor pointer the value needs
//! somewhere else to live.  See `emacs_core::defvar_object` for the
//! declaration table and the adoption pass, and `Obarray::trace_roots` for
//! why a leaked descriptor owning a heap [`Value`] is a rooted object here
//! rather than the failure class entries 161-163 closed -- `Int` has worked
//! that way since 132, and `LispFwd::owned_value` now decides membership so
//! a new variant cannot be added and left untraced.
