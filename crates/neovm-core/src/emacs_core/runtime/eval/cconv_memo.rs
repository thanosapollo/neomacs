//! Interpreted-closure creation through `cconv-make-interpreted-closure`
//! (P4.1 Stage 0): an exact memo of its analysis, its statistics, and the
//! effect snapshot.
//!
//! GNU's `Ffunction` (src/eval.c:560-627) hands every `#'(lambda ...)`
//! evaluated in a non-empty lexical environment to
//! `internal-make-interpreted-closure-function`, whose value in a dumped
//! Emacs is `cconv-make-interpreted-closure` (lisp/emacs-lisp/cconv.el:
//! 905-972).  When the environment binds lexical variables that function
//! runs `macroexpand-all` and `cconv-fv` over the lambda to trim the
//! environment: about 113K instructions per closure, against 6.9K for the
//! rest of a typical creation.
//!
//! # What is memoized
//!
//! A trimming call is *eligible* when the memo could serve it: the trusted
//! set stands (`cconv_trust`), a well-formed environment, a source whose
//! [`ClosureShape`] and [`ClosureFacts`] exist, no interactive form, and
//! every head [`HeadVerdict::Plain`] -- no macro, autoloaded macro or
//! compiler macro, as `macroexpand-1` (macroexp.el:225-247) and
//! `function-get` (subr.el:4836-4854) would see it.
//!
//! The first eligible call on a body is *recorded*: the real Lisp runs, and
//! its result is kept only if it signalled nothing, moved no
//! [`EffectSnapshot`] counter, left the trusted set standing and returned an
//! identity closure (args and body `eq` to the inputs) whose environment is
//! `(assq V ENV)` cells for some lexical variables V followed by some bare
//! symbols, or cconv's `(t)` constant.  The entry keeps that *analysis* --
//! the ordered captured variables and dynamic symbols -- never a closure,
//! keyed by the body's address and validated on every use:
//!
//! - V1: the trusted set still stands;
//! - V2: the live `(ARGS . BODY)` has the recorded [`ClosureShape`] (a
//!   recycled address or a mutated body just misses);
//! - V3: the environment's lexical and dynamic entries are the recorded
//!   ones, in order;
//! - V4: the visible `lexical-binding` has the recorded truth value
//!   (`cconv--not-lexical-var-p` reads the caller's value, cconv.el:641);
//! - V5: every head's [`HeadVerdict`] is still `Plain` and every symbol's
//!   `special-variable-p` is unchanged (a later `defvar`, `defmacro`,
//!   compiler macro or autoload misses);
//! - V7: `max-lisp-eval-depth` leaves room for the depth the real run would
//!   use (4 per nesting level plus 64), so the memo never succeeds where GNU
//!   signals `excessive-lisp-nesting`.
//!
//! A hit builds what cconv.el:966-972 builds: a fresh list of the live
//! environment's `(assq V ENV)` cells and the dynamic symbols, or the `(t)`
//! constant, and `make-interpreted-closure` of the live args, body,
//! docstring and interactive form.  The memo does not run while
//! `debug-on-next-call` is armed, a quit is pending, or
//! `macroexpand-all-environment`, `overriding-plist-environment`,
//! `macroexp-inhibit-compiler-macros` or `symbols-with-pos-enabled` is
//! non-nil.
//!
//! Excluded from exactness, as for P0.9's unboxed floats: allocation volume
//! and what depends on it (`cons-cells-consed`, GC timing, and so when
//! finalizers and `post-gc-hook` run: GNU runs both at the end of
//! `garbage_collect`, src/alloc.c:5960 and 5986-5990, at whichever
//! `maybe_gc` point -- eval.c:2602, eval.c:3206, bytecode.c -- allocation
//! trips a collection, inside a cconv run or, when the memo spares that
//! allocation, somewhere after it).
//!
//! # Knob
//!
//! `NEOVM_CCONV_MEMO` (read once per process):
//! - `0` or `off`: closure creation exactly as it was;
//! - `stats`: record and look up, count every outcome ([`CconvMemoEvent`]),
//!   but always run the Lisp;
//! - unset, `on` (or `1`): serve hits -- the default since the MELPA verify
//!   soak (942 package batches, 0 mismatches) and the board A/B
//!   (rust-lsp-typing -42% instructions, org-journal-open -14%,
//!   magit-status -3.9%);
//! - `verify`: on a hit build the memo closure *and* run the Lisp, compare
//!   them element by element, return the Lisp's closure and count
//!   mismatches; `NEOVM_CCONV_MEMO_STRICT=1` (and test builds) panic on one.
//!
//! `NEOVM_CCONV_FAST` (read once per process; on by default, `off` or `0`
//! disables) serves the untrimmed case natively (S0.6): when the environment
//! binds no lexical variable, or the body starts with
//! `:closure-dont-trim-context` followed by more forms, cconv.el:923-949
//! only asserts `(consp body)` and `(listp args)`, drops the marker, and
//! calls `make-interpreted-closure` with the environment unchanged.  The
//! native path does exactly that while the trusted set stands (the filter
//! and `make-interpreted-closure` are the dumped ones), outside
//! `debug-on-next-call` and a pending quit, with 8 levels of
//! `max-lisp-eval-depth` to spare; an assertion or argument error runs the
//! Lisp so it signals from the same frames.  Under `NEOVM_CCONV_MEMO=verify`
//! it is compared with the Lisp like a memo hit.
//!
//! The counts are logged at `info` under the `neovm::cconv_memo` target every
//! 4096 trimming calls and once more at `kill-emacs` (`final ...`);
//! [`Context::cconv_memo_report`] formats them.  In `--batch`, set
//! `NEOMACS_LOG_FILE=<path> RUST_LOG=neovm::cconv_memo=info` to see them.
//!
//! # Effect snapshot
//!
//! [`EffectSnapshot`] is a cheap, generic "did this Lisp run do anything
//! observable" check: loads, echo-area output, buffer creation and text
//! changes, `gensym-counter`, function-cell writes, newly interned symbols and
//! the match data.  Taken before and after a run, a difference means the run
//! had an effect.  A collection that completes while a run is observed this
//! way (a recording or verify run) leaves its finalizers and `post-gc-hook`
//! until after the second snapshot, so the snapshot charges the conversion
//! with its own effects only; they still run before the filter returns.  A
//! verify mismatch names the fields that moved (and the function cells
//! written, and the collections completed, during the run).
