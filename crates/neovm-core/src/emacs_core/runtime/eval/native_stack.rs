//! The native-stack guard of compiled Lisp: GNU `setup_frame`'s
//! `error ("Bytecode stack overflow")` (src/bytecode.c:514-515) for the stack
//! JIT leaves recurse on.
//!
//! GNU byte code keeps its frames on a bytecode stack of its own (512K words,
//! `BC_STACK_SIZE`, src/bytecode.c:337), so a deep byte-compiled recursion
//! under a raised `max-lisp-eval-depth` ends in that error. Compiled leaves
//! here recurse on the thread's native stack, while the Tier-0 interpreter
//! and the tree walker probe it and continue on a fresh stacker segment.
//! Nothing bounded a leaf-to-leaf recursion but `max-lisp-eval-depth`, so
//! past a few hundred thousand levels the process died of SIGSEGV.
//!
//! The guard is one field, [`Context::jit_stack_limit`]: the lowest address a
//! compiled leaf's caller-owned result slot may sit at when the leaf is
//! entered. A leaf whose body can re-enter Lisp compares its `out` pointer
//! against it in its entry block (`jit::compile::stack_guard`) -- one compare
//! with a memory operand and a branch, since `out` is a word of the calling
//! frame -- and below it calls `neovm_jit_stack_check`, which measures the
//! real stack ([`native_stack_exhausted`]) and either signals GNU's error or
//! lets the leaf run (a stale limit: the code runs on a stack segment below
//! the one the limit names).
//!
//! The limit follows the stack segment the thread runs on:
//! [`Context::setup_thread_locals`] sets it for the thread's own stack, and
//! the stacker probes that switch segments ([`maybe_grow_tracking_jit_limit`])
//! point it at the new segment for the callback's duration and restore it
//! after, on unwinds too. A segment the limit does not know sits either below
//! it (every guarded entry takes the measuring slow path, which is exact) or
//! above it (no guard there: the state before this module, never a false
//! signal).
//!
//! Everything above trusts stacker's idea of where a segment ends, and for
//! the process's main thread (the batch and `-nw` evaluator) that is glibc's
//! `pthread_getattr_np`: the lower of the `RLIMIT_STACK` bound and the end of
//! the mapping below the stack. The kernel stops the stack `stack_guard_gap`
//! (1 MiB) short of that mapping, which glibc does not count, so the
//! editor's `RLIMIT_STACK` must never promise more stack than the address
//! space holds -- [`raise_main_stack_rlimit`] keeps that true.
