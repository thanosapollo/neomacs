//! Always-on metering of synchronous JIT compile stalls.
//!
//! The JIT compiles on the eval thread at the first hot call (the cache-miss
//! path in [`super::cache`]), so every compile is a stall the caller feels.
//! This module aggregates how long those stalls are — the evidence base for
//! sizing (or rejecting) background compilation. A compile happens once per
//! function per thread per session (cold path), so the two `Instant` reads per
//! compile are negligible and the metering is unconditionally on.
//!
//! # The report channel
//!
//! Every `[neovm-jit-*]` line goes through [`report_line`]: stderr by
//! default, or the file named by `NEOVM_JIT_STATS_FILE=<path>` (appended).
//! These lines are a measurement REPORT a knob explicitly asked for, not a
//! diagnostic log, so they bypass `tracing` on purpose: under the neomacs
//! subscriber the default filter is `warn`, `LogTarget::Stdout` writes to
//! stdout (which would corrupt batch benchmark output) and `LogTarget::File`
//! is silent — a tracing-only report would vanish or pollute. Nothing is
//! printed unless a knob asks for it, and stdout is never written.
