//! Executable memory for the persistent JIT module (P2.4 B4 = P0.6 L4-C4).
//!
//! Cranelift's default `SystemMemoryProvider` maps a fresh anonymous region
//! for every leaf (mmap, first-touch fault, mprotect to read+execute), and
//! the region is leaked on purpose when the leaf's module drops: code is
//! never freed while the process lives, because a raw entry pointer may
//! outlive its leaf (spec slots, retired leaves). The arena keeps exactly
//! that lifetime rule — nothing it hands out is ever unmapped or written
//! again after it is sealed — and removes the per-leaf mapping:
//!
//! - [`CodeArena`] reserves large read+write regions once
//!   (`MAP_NORESERVE`: untouched pages cost nothing) and hands out whole
//!   pages by bumping a pointer; pages are pre-faulted a window at a time
//!   (`MADV_POPULATE_WRITE`) instead of one fault per leaf;
//! - an [`ArenaHandle`] (one per module generation, all of one thread's
//!   handles sharing its arena) is the module's `JITMemoryProvider`: code
//!   is bump-allocated into the pages it holds, and `finalize` seals every
//!   page written since the last seal read+execute with ONE mprotect. A
//!   sealed page is never handed out or written again, so the next leaf
//!   starts on a fresh page and code already running is never touched.
//!
//! Per synchronous compile that is one mprotect and no mmap, and the pages
//! of consecutive leaves are adjacent (one mapping, better iTLB locality).
//! Pages are not shared between leaves, so resident code memory is what it
//! was (a page per small leaf).
//!
//! x86-64 Linux only: there, instruction fetch is coherent with the data
//! writes of the same thread and cross-thread visibility of fresh code is
//! not needed (a leaf runs on the thread that compiled it). Other targets
//! keep Cranelift's provider, which does the cache maintenance they need.
