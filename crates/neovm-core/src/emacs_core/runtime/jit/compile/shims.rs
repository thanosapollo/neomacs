// Panic containment at the JIT shim boundary.
//
// Every shim here is `extern "C"` and is called from Cranelift frames with no
// landing pads: a panic that escapes a shim body aborts the process ("panic
// in a function that cannot unwind"). The 21 shims whose return ABI has a
// signal channel — a `STATUS_*` code, `neovm_jit_match_handler`'s `-1`
// rethrow ordinal, `neovm_jit_switch`'s [`JIT_SWITCH_STALE`], or a body the
// generated code follows with an unconditional signal-exit branch
// (`neovm_jit_throw`, `neovm_jit_switch_stale`) — contain panics via
// [`jit_shim_contain!`]: the panic becomes a pending
// `Signal(error, "neomacs internal error: …")` and the shim returns its
// signal sentinel, so the EXISTING plumbing takes over (generated code
// branches to its signal exit or handler match, the leaf returns
// STATUS_SIGNAL, the dispatcher takes the flow and propagates a normal Lisp
// error — condition-case-able, editor keeps running).
//
// The wrapper itself is a bare `catch_unwind`: shims are the JIT's hot path
// (the per-backedge quit poll runs once per 255 loop iterations, `varref` on
// every dynamic read), so the happy path carries ZERO containment cost — no
// snapshot, no root bookkeeping, nothing before the catch besides the body.
// Restoration is instead anchored at LEAF ENTRY: `invoke_native` records the
// evaluator bases once per native call ([`JitLeafBases`]), and a contained
// panic is healed against them downstream, at the two points that see it —
// `neovm_jit_match_handler` entry (leaf-local condition-case) and the
// leaf-exit path in `invoke_native`. Leaf-entry bases are exact there
// because every healed field is balanced across each shim call the leaf
// makes; the residue a panic leaves is precisely "above the bases". See
// `Context::restore_jit_shim_boundary` for the field-by-field story.
//
// The other 19 shims (`gc_save`/`gc_push`/`gc_restore`, `cons`, `list`, the
// pure predicate slow paths, `varbind`/`unbind`, the specpdl/handler-frame
// pushes and `pop_handler`) have NO signal channel: generated code consumes
// their return value or assumes the state transition happened,
// unconditionally. "Containing" a panic there would mean returning garbage
// and letting native code keep executing against half-applied state — e.g. a
// fabricated `gc_save` depth would make the paired `gc_restore` truncate
// LIVE scratch roots (use-after-free under exact GC). Strictly worse than
// the abort, so they stay unwrapped: a panic there keeps today's behavior
// (abort at the `extern "C"` boundary).
