//! `SpecSlot` v2 (p1-0-integration §3.1, S0.8): the per-site speculation
//! state compiled code and the call shims share, and the one statement of
//! what each of its words means for each kind of site.
//!
//! A slot is four words, baked into generated code by address (JIT) or
//! indexed off the sidecar (AOT, stride `size_of::<SpecSlot>()`, salted into
//! the ABI tag):
//!
//! | word | offset | [`SpecSlotKind::Bytecode`] | [`SpecSlotKind::Subr`] |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `epoch` | 0 | clock at the last validation ([`SPEC_EPOCH_DISARMED`] never matches) | same |
//! | `leaf` | 8 | `*const CompiledLeaf`, or 0 | the expected subr's bits (immutable) |
//! | `direct_consts` | 16 | the shim's key: constant base with `KEY_*` flags, or 0 | the site's `SymId` (immutable) |
//! | `direct_entry` | 24 | the raw entry (register, or memory under `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_MEMORY`), [`DirectEntryTag::Framed`], or 0 | 0 |
//!
//! Only a [`SpecSlotKind::Bytecode`] slot's `leaf`, `direct_consts` and
//! `direct_entry` ever change after the slot is built, so only those are
//! ever cleared: every slot walker goes through
//! [`CompiledLeaf::bytecode_spec_slots`]. Clearing a subr slot's words would
//! make its re-validation fail forever (a silent permanent fall to the
//! reference path), so `clear_leaf` refuses one in debug builds.
