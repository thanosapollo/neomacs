//! Direct native calls between compiled leaves (design
//! `p1-1-direct-native-calls` §3.4-§3.5, P1.0 S2.1c; `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_CALL`,
//! default on with profitable exact self sites).
//!
//! A speculated `Op::Call` site of a byte-code callee runs GNU's `Bcall`
//! protocol inline instead of calling `neovm_jit_call_spec`, when the site's
//! spec slot holds a direct entry (armed by `arm_direct_entry_if_eligible`:
//! an exact-arity, frameless leaf). The hit path makes the
//! shim fast path's checks, in its order, each its own branch to the shim:
//!
//! 1. the slot's `direct_entry` is armed;
//! 2. the attention words are clear under `AttentionMask::SPEC_CALL` (the
//!    shim's gate: quit-flag, throw-on-input, the force harness) and the
//!    asynchronous word (profiler tick, OS signal, quit requests);
//! 3. the slot's epoch is the obarray's function epoch (no function cell
//!    anywhere changed since the slot was validated);
//! 4. `debug-on-next-call` is not armed;
//! 5. `depth < max_depth`;
//! 6. the specpdl has room for one entry (the shim grows it).
//!
//! It then pushes the frame the shim pushes -- `Backtrace1`/`Backtrace2`
//! with the arguments inline, or `BacktraceNative` pointing at the caller's
//! argument slot, recording the called SYMBOL (GNU `Bcall`'s `call_fun`) --
//! bumps `depth`, and calls the entry with the arguments in registers (or
//! through the existing argument/result slots under
//! `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_MEMORY=on`, unless `NEOVM_JIT_REG_ABI=on`). On a
//! `STATUS_OK` return whose frame is still the one it pushed, it pops the
//! frame and `depth` inline; anything else (a non-OK status, a frame the
//! debugger flagged or promoted, an unbalanced specpdl) goes to
//! [`neovm_jit_direct_finish`], which is the shim's own cold exit
//! (`call_spec_finish`). A failed check goes to the shim itself, which runs
//! the reference protocol. So every path but the hit is today's code, and
//! the hit does exactly what the shim's fast path does.
//!
//! `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_SHAPES=framed` (Stage 2c) admits exact required-only
//! JIT bodies with bindings or handlers. Their slot publishes
//! `DirectEntryTag::Framed`, not a register entry. After the same guards,
//! original frame push and depth increment, the lazy-table trampoline owns
//! the memory-ABI invocation, boxed precise deopt and all frame/depth cleanup.
//! The generated register call and pop are never taken for a framed tag.
//!
//! The finish is called by its baked address, never imported: direct calls
//! are JIT-only, and an AOT object can never reference it.
