//! Cold exit blocks (P2.2 O0.2, knob `NEOVM_JIT_COLD_EXITS`).
//!
//! Cranelift lowers a function's blocks in a depth-first order over the
//! CFG, not in layout order, and moves only blocks marked cold to the end
//! (`machinst/vcode.rs`, "cold blocks at the end"; an edge block split in
//! front of a cold block is cold too). Without the mark an exit reached by a
//! guard's `brif` lands between hot blocks: the hot path then jumps over it,
//! and it shares the hot code's cache lines.
//!
//! The exits, in both tiers (the baseline and MIR share every emitter):
//!
//! | exit | where it is filled |
//! |---|---|
//! | precise deopt (`STATUS_DEOPT_AT`) | `emit_pending_deopts` |
//! | rerun deopt (`STATUS_DEOPT`, pure MIR) | `build_mir_leaf_fn` |
//! | the shared signal exit (`STATUS_SIGNAL`) | `build_leaf_fn`, `build_mir_leaf_fn` |
//! | a handler dispatch (a signal inside a protected extent) | `emit_pending_dispatches` |
//! | the back-edge poll's slow path | `emit_backedge_jump_with_args` |
//! | a root-window grow call | `emit_root_window_stores`, `emit_hoisted_root_window_prologue` |
//!
//! Every exit is already shared where its state is: one signal exit and one
//! rerun block per function, one deopt block per guarded op (all its guards
//! branch there), one dispatch per protected signal site. `share` also
//! shares what the precise-deopt blocks have in common: each one spills its
//! own framestate and jumps to the function's one deopt tail with its pc,
//! depth and handler count, and the tail writes the cells and returns
//! (`lowering::deopt_tail`), instead of every site carrying those stores
//! and a return epilogue of its own.
//!
//! An exit that branches further (the poll's rooting and signal check, a
//! dispatch's handler compare chain) is marked with every block created
//! while it was emitted ([`ColdSpan`]): those are reachable only through it.
//! The mark changes where code goes, never what it does; off, nothing is
//! marked that was not marked before, so the CLIF is identical.
