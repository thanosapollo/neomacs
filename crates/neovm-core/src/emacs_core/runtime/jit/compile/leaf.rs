/// ## Why a per-leaf sidecar
/// AOT code lives in a process-shared `.so`, but the buffers it addresses are
/// per-(thread,leaf): each thread rebuilds its OWN reloc `Vec` (against its OWN
/// thread-local heap) and allocates its OWN deopt buffers, all pointing at the
/// SAME code. The JIT bakes those addresses as `iconst` immediates — impossible
/// across sessions/threads in a shared `.so`. Instead AOT code loads each base
/// from THIS struct, whose pointer arrives as a call argument. Because the
/// pointer is a per-frame argument (passed by [`CompiledLeaf::invoke_native`]
/// from `&self`), reentrancy is automatic: leaf A's frame carries A's sidecar,
/// and A calling B does not perturb it.
///
/// ## Move-stability (load-bearing invariant)
/// The pointers address the leaf's SIBLING `Box` fields (`reloc_data`,
/// `deopt_spill`, `deopt_meta`). A `Box`'s heap pointee is move-stable, so they
/// stay valid when the owning `CompiledLeaf` moves into `Rc::new`. They MUST be
/// captured from the FINAL boxes (after the buffers are in place) and NOTHING
/// may reallocate those boxes after the sidecar is filled — the boxes are
/// immutable for the leaf's life (the `Cell`s inside are mutated in place, which
/// does not move the allocation). The sidecar is itself a `Box` (address-stable)
