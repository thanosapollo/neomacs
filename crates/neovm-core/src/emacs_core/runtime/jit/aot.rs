//! Ahead-of-time (AOT) object emission for compiled leaves (Phase R1c).
//!
//! AOT is a **fourth code producer**, never a deopt target: it emits the *same*
//! CLIF the JIT does (via the R1b `compile::build_mir_leaf_fn::<M: Module>` seam)
//! but routes it through Cranelift's [`ObjectModule`] instead of `JITModule`, so
//! the result is a relocatable `.o` rather than executable memory. The `.o` is
//! later linked into a `.so` (`cc -shared`) and `dlopen`'d, its entry inserted
//! into the per-thread `COMPILED` cache as a pre-warmed [`CompiledLeaf`]
//! (R1c-4..6). Tier-0 `bytecode::Vm` stays the sole oracle + `DeoptAt` landing
//! pad; the GC is concurrent non-moving, so AOT's only GC duty is liveness +
//! SATB-correct root publication (R1c-8) — no fixup/stackmaps.
//!
//! ## The three JIT seams AOT replaces (cf. `build_mir_leaf_fn`'s doc)
//!   * `builder.symbol(...)`    — JIT bakes shim host addresses; AOT leaves the
//!     `neovm_jit_*` shims as **undefined `Linkage::Import`s** (declared by
//!     `declare_rt_refs`), resolved by the dynamic loader against the host
//!     process at `dlopen` (host links `-rdynamic`; R1c-5).
//!   * `finalize_definitions()` — replaced by `ObjectModule::finish().emit()`.
//!   * `get_finalized_function` — replaced by a `dlsym` of the exported entry.
//!
//! Only built with the `jit` feature (links Cranelift).
