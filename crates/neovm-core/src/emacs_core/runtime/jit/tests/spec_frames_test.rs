//! Backtrace frames of speculated calls (design `p1-1-direct-native-calls`
//! 0b, P1.0 S1.3 = U0.2): a compiled caller's call of a symbol records the
//! SYMBOL, as GNU's `Bcall` does (`record_in_backtrace (call_fun = TOP)`,
//! src/bytecode.c:792-796), not the byte-code object the symbol names -- so
//! `mapbacktrace` and `backtrace-frame` see what the interpreter shows -- and
//! the object stays alive while it runs even after its symbol is redefined
//! (GNU's bytecode frame holds `fp->fun`, src/bytecode.c:518).
