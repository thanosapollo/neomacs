// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the `neovm_jit_*` runtime-shim name set (R2-C2).
//
// This list is the one authoritative enumeration of every runtime shim an AOT
// `.so` may import. It is consumed THREE ways, all via `include!` of THIS file
// so they can never drift:
//   1. `jit/aot.rs` — `MIR_SHIM_NAMES` (salted into `ABI_TAG`, and the hard
//      emit-time import-subset guard `assert_aot_imports_exported`).
//   2. `neovm-core/build.rs` — exports each shim into the lib's dynamic symbol
//      table (`-rdynamic` + per-shim `--export-dynamic-symbol`) for integration
//      tests' `.so` imports to resolve.
//   3. `crates/neomacs/build.rs` — the same export for the production `neomacs`
//      binary, so the dump-time preload `.so`'s imports resolve at runtime.
//
// MUST stay in sync with the shim DEFINITIONS in `compile.rs` (`#[no_mangle] pub
// extern "C" fn neovm_jit_*`) and the `JIT_SHIM_TABLE` array. `include!`-ing a
// bare `const` keeps this usable both as a crate item (aot.rs) and as a local
// const inside each build.rs `main` (no module/use context required).
