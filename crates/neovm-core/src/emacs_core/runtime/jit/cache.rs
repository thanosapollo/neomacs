//! Per-thread compiled-code cache and the baseline JIT tier-up entry point.
//!
//! The dispatch seam (`eval.rs`) calls [`try_run_compiled`] once a function is
//! hot ([`super::Plan::Compiled`]). Compiled code is cached **per thread**,
//! keyed by the function's stable [`super::Runtime::compiled_id`]:
//!
//! - A [`CompiledLeaf`] owns executable memory and a raw code pointer, so it is
//!   `!Send + !Sync`. Each mutator owns its compiled cache and activation state.
//!   The legacy shared source leaf slot also carries an address into this cache;
//!   it still requires an owner-local replacement before parallel activation.
//! - The id is monotonic and never reused, so a function that is GC'd (freeing
//!   the memory its compiled code baked constant pointers into) can never have
//!   its stale cache entry looked up again — even after the non-moving GC reuses
//!   its heap address, the new function there gets a *new* id. Stale entries for
//!   dead functions linger until thread exit (a bounded leak), never a
//!   use-after-free.
