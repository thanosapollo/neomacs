//! The tier spine's countdown and cold C7/C9 policy (P2.1 C6/C7/C9 + W1).
//!
//! A T1 leaf under `NEOVM_JIT_TIER2=on` has a per-leaf budget: entry takes
//! one, an entered cold back-edge poll takes `T2_LOOP_CREDIT`, and a mapping
//! builtin's profiling shim takes `len / 64` only during the profile window.
//! The existing 255-taken-back-edge quit-poll cadence and its hot code stay
//! unchanged. Optional lazy-table imports call the cold request without Lisp
//! allocation or a safepoint; the current activation continues in T1.
//!
//! The first request captures feedback and requires one stable work window.
//! Later requests compare exact lattice snapshots, check the compile budget,
//! and choose full-allocator T1' or the existing backend with feedback. Upgrade
//! jobs retain the working T1 until installation. A feedback upgrade retains T1
//! as its fallback; a conclusive/repeated T2 deopt widens the existing source
//! policy before reverting to T1. The bounded source ban survives cache evictions.
//! Opt requests waiting for CPU budget close feedback recording and HOF credit;
//! only entry and poll work drive their retry countdown. Once affordable, they
//! reopen profiling and HOF credit for a full fresh stable sampling window.
//! Off, profiling emission and the heat-driven re-tier stay unchanged.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! Leaves and their plain `Cell`/`RefCell` policy state belong to one mutator.
//! The scoped compile publication is per compiler thread, never a cache of
//! Lisp values, and is restored after nested compiles. Shared source feedback
//! and bans use their existing atomic accessors; exact snapshots are conservative
//! observations, not transactional reads. All generated type/epoch/source guards
//! remain in force if another mutator widens feedback. Per-mutator budget TLS
//! contains resource counters only, and workers return CPU costs to their owner.
