//! Tiered execution subsystem for the Emacs-Lisp VM — the foundation of the
//! modern JIT path. See `bytecode/ELISP_VM_MODERNIZATION.md` for the full
//! design + phased roadmap.
//!
//! Gated behind the `jit` cargo feature, which is **default-ON** (`default =
//! ["jit"]`): both the baseline (Tier-1) Cranelift JIT and the optimizing
//! typed-MIR Tier-2 above it are qualified and shipping. The bytecode
//! interpreter (`bytecode::Vm`) is always the **Tier 0** engine — the
//! correctness oracle that mirrors GNU Emacs 31.0.90 and the deoptimization
//! landing pad. It is never removed.
//!
//! Design rule (carried over from the GC work): every dispatch over an
//! execution tier is an **exhaustive `match`** with no catch-all arm, so adding
//! a tier fails to compile until every site handles it. That is the same
//! compiler-enforced completeness that caught the GC `trace_veclike`
//! use-after-free (an incomplete duplicate with a `_ => {}` arm).
//!
//! # Environment-knob inventory (the authoritative list)
//!
//! Every runtime toggle this subsystem reads, with default and status. Grep
//! anchor: `env::var("NEOVM_`. Keep this table in sync when adding a knob, and
//! give every OPT-IN knob a graduation plan — soak → default-on, or delete —
//! so the surface doesn't accumulate permanently-dead branches.
//!
//! ## Runtime switches (shipping, default-on)
//! | Knob | Default | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT` | on | Kill switch: `0`/`off`/`false`/`no` forces the pure interpreter (the A/B baseline). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_THRESHOLD` | 1000 | Tier-up heat threshold ([`Runtime::HOT_THRESHOLD`]); `=1` compiles every compilable function — the differential soak and the strictest oracle configuration. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LOOP_HEAT` | 8 | Heat credited per 256-iteration back-edge wrap (32 iterations ≈ one call; a hot loop tiers up near 32k iterations); `=0` disables loop heat — the pre-loop-heat baseline. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LEVER1` | on | Residual-rooting non-heap skip; `=off` reverts to an unconditional gc_push per residual (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_OSR` | on | Mid-loop interpreter→native transfer (on-stack replacement); `=off` disables. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_PROFIT` | on | Profitability gate (calls ≤ arith); `=off` also compiles call-heavy bodies. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE` | on | Bytecode fuser: splice a constant-bytecode callee into its caller before lowering (`jit/inline.rs`); `=off` disables. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REOPT` | on | Deopt-driven reoptimization (`jit/reopt.rs`): a conclusive or repeated deopt widens the site's feedback, retires the stale leaf and recompiles after a re-profile window, with a bounded backoff ladder. `=off`/`0`/`false`/`no`: deopts are still counted (the census) but never widen feedback or invalidate — the pre-reopt behaviour and the single-build A/B arm. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REOPT_HEAT` | `NEOVM_JIT_THRESHOLD` | Re-profile window: interpreted calls between an invalidation and the recompile. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REOPT_MAX` | 4 | Invalidations of one source before each further one climbs a `ReoptLevel` (`Speculative` → `NoInline` → `BaselineOnly` → `Generic` → `Interpreter`). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REOPT_SITE_LIMIT` | 4 | Non-conclusive deopts (overflow, call-site guard, rerun, OSR entry) counted at one pc of one leaf before the forced response. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_ISA_CACHE` | on | Build the Cranelift ISA once per register allocator per process (`lowering::jit_isa`) instead of once per compile (host-CPU probe + by-name setting resolution); `=off` rebuilds per compile (single-build A/B; the code is identical). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LAZY_SHIMS` | on | A leaf imports a runtime shim into its CLIF function on first use (`compile::shim_refs`), so it carries only the signatures it calls; `=off` imports the whole declared set up front in the old order (CLIF-identical to before; the machine code is the same either way). Single-build A/B. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_PERSISTENT_MODULE` | on | Leaves compile into one long-lived `JITModule` per register allocator per thread (`compile::shared`): shims registered and declared once, Cranelift contexts reused, entries anonymous (or uniquely named under per-function naming), the module replaced every 1024 leaves to bound its bookkeeping; on x86-64 Linux the code goes into a per-thread arena (`compile::code_arena`: pre-reserved pages, one mprotect per leaf, never unmapped). `=off` builds a module per leaf on Cranelift's default memory, as before (single-build A/B; identical machine code). Counters: `[neovm-jit-final-code-memory]`. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_MIR_OPAQUE` | on | The MIR tier lowers shim-using ops (variable ops, builtins, `eq`, list ops) through the baseline's emitters; `=0`/`off` makes every such op bail the body to the baseline — an A/B of the adapter alone: the tier gate (`gate:loop-opaque`/`generic-call`/`inline-opaque`) applies either way, so it is not the pre-adapter gate. |
//! | `NEOVM_VAR_CACHE` | on | P1.4 Stage A cached variable tiers (`eval/var_fast.rs`): the read, `setq`, `let` and unbind of a buffer-local or forwarded variable answered from its BLV cache or forwarder, used by the JIT var shims, the interpreter's `varset`/`varbind`/`unbind` and the tree walker's `let`; `=0`/`off`/`none` disables all four, a comma list of `read`,`set`,`bind`,`unbind` enables those (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_BUILTIN_FRONTEND` | on | U2.8 builtin front-end diets (`eval/builtin_vars.rs`): the search, syntax and text-property builtins read their control variables through the typed reader, buffer regexp searches / `looking-at` / `string-match` parse and compile once and skip the syntax-property resolver when no Lisp can run, match data is published from the engine registers in place, `skip-syntax-*` parse their class string in place, literal searches borrow the pattern, `parse-partial-sexp` conses its state from the stack; `=0`/`off`/`none` restores every general path (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_PPS_PROPERTIZE` | on | U0.7 parity fix (`syntax/pps_propertize.rs`): `parse-partial-sexp` runs `syntax-propertize` where GNU's `scan_sexps_forward` does (entering text `syntax-propertize--done` does not cover, with `parse-sexp-lookup-properties` non-nil); `=0`/`off` never propertizes, for attribution only. |
//!
//! | `NEOVM_SYNTAX_PARSE_CACHE` | on | P3.4 L1 syntax parse cache (`syntax/parse_cache.rs`): `parse-partial-sexp` resumes from recorded loop states of earlier scans with the same FROM, state, options and environment, or answers a repeated TO outright; `=0`/`off` disables; `=verify` recomputes every cached answer with a plain scan, counts and logs mismatches (and fails debug builds). `NEOVM_SYNTAX_PARSE_CACHE_CHUNK` (2048) spaces the recorded states, `NEOVM_SYNTAX_PARSE_CACHE_MIN_SPAN` (128) is the shortest scan that starts a run, `NEOVM_SYNTAX_PARSE_CACHE_STATS=PATH` rewrites the counters to PATH every 256 queries. |
//!
//! ## Opt-in features (default-OFF, pending a graduation decision)
//! | Knob | Enable | Meaning / graduation blocker |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE2` | off; `=named`, `=closure`, `=hof`, `=all` | P2.3's front runs before the backend choice. `named`/`all` admit direct named cells on the existing re-tier path (or self-recursive Full compile), with virtual frames, per-cell identity, attention and depth guards. Named bodies remain observation-free under F-I1 rule 2. `closure`/`all` add in-unit make-closure calls; `hof`/`all` add list-only mapc/mapcar intrinsics, including OSR chains. Legacy MIR refuses fused-v2 bodies. Read at compile time; off preserves the original CLIF. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE2_AT_FIRST_COMPILE` | off; `=1` | Oracle diagnostic: admit named selection at the first compile to exercise THRESHOLD=1 pins. Production named admission otherwise requires the existing re-tier path or self-recursive Full compile. Read once; no effect with INLINE2=off. |
//! | `NEOVM_SYNTAX_PARSE_CACHE_L2` | `=1`/`on`, `=verify` | P3.4 S5–S6 canonical syntax run (`syntax/parse_canon.rs`), with L1 enabled: option-free queries reuse BEGV states by FROM agreement or later full-state synchronization; warm backward-comment scans reuse validated canonical states. `verify` recomputes complete answers and point. Large-file, SMIE and full-suite verify gates pass; S7 graduation awaits the design's quiet-machine run and week of verify-mode oracle CI. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_ARITH` | `=on` | Level-B native bit-ops (logand/logior/logxor/lognot) with fixnum-guard deopt. Blocker: skips the compiler-macro bounce; a mixed-type loop falls back to the interpreter ungracefully. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_TYPE_OF` | on | Answer a record's `type-of`/`cl-type-of` inline at an armed JIT site; `=off` calls `neovm_jit_pred_spec` everywhere (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_AREF` | on | Inline slot reads at JIT `aref` sites on plain vectors and records; `=off` calls `neovm_jit_aref` everywhere (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_AREF_SLOT0` | off | MEASUREMENT ONLY (P3.2 L0.9 / U2.10): re-emit the retired slot-0 tagged-vector test in inline `aref`/`aset` (no tagged vectors exist since P3.2 L0.8; a vector whose slot 0 is a tag symbol goes to the shim, which answers the same slot). Same-binary A/B of what the test cost. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_ALLOC` | on | Allocate conses (`Op::Cons`, escaping `MirOp::Cons`) and box floats (float sites under `NEOVM_JIT_FLONUM=off`, flonum escape boxes) inline by bumping the heap's cons/float allocation region (`compile::heap_inline`); `=off` calls `neovm_jit_cons`/`neovm_jit_make_float` everywhere (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_HEAP_WRITE` | on | Inline stores at JIT `setcar`/`setcdr` sites when the cons lies outside the write barrier's owner window, and at JIT `aset` sites on owned plain vectors and records whose owner the barrier need not see (`compile::heap_inline`); `=off` calls `neovm_jit_setcar`/`_setcdr`/`_aset` everywhere (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FLONUM` | `resident` | Unboxed float results at `Float`-feedback arithmetic sites (`compile::FlonumMode`): `off` boxes every result at its site (the prior lowering, CLIF-identical); `local` keeps a result unboxed while float arithmetic/compares, stack shuffles and variable reads consume it; `resident` also keeps it across audited ops (calls, `aref`, `aset`, ...) that box only their own operands. Single-build A/B of all three. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_TAIL_UNROOTED` | on | A call in tail position (`Return` next, no handler frame active) roots none of the operand-stack slots below its callee, which are dead (`lowering::tail_call_dead_residuals`); `=off` roots them as before, CLIF-identical (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_ARGS_FIRST` | on | A MIR leaf's entry reads its arguments before the hoisted root-window check, so the argument pointer is not live across the check's cold grow call; `=off` reads them after it, as before, CLIF-identical (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REG_ABI` | off | JIT leaf bodies a direct call can enter (not AOT, not OSR; frameless, not `make-closure`-patched, at most 6 required parameters and no `&optional`/`&rest`) take their arguments in registers and return `(value, status)` in `rax:rdx` (`compile::reg_abi`); native-to-native callers pick the entry by the leaf's `EntryShape` or the spec slot's key flags, both decided once, so a memory-ABI body pays no ABI test. `=off` keeps every entry on the memory ABI `fn(vmctx, args, out, sidecar) -> status`, CLIF-identical to before (single-build A/B). Implied globally by `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_CALL=on` unless `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_MEMORY=on` or `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_SITES=self`; explicit `=on` always retains register bodies and shape marshaling. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_CALL` | off | A speculated call of a compiled, exact-arity, frameless byte-code leaf calls the leaf's selected raw entry from the site (attention, epoch, depth and specpdl checks, the lean backtrace push and pop inline; `lowering::emit_direct_bytecode_call`), with `neovm_jit_call_spec` as the slow path; spec slots arm a `direct_entry` (S2.1b), which the site keys on (S2.1c). `=off` arms and emits nothing, CLIF-identical to before (single-build A/B). Implies the register ABI globally unless `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_MEMORY=on` or `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_SITES=self`. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_MEMORY` | off | With direct calls on and the register ABI off, exact pass-through frameless JIT callees retain their existing memory ABI and direct sites call `fn(vmctx, args, out, aux) -> status` through the caller's existing argument/result slots. Named and source/constant calls share the existing guards, frame/depth push/pop and cold finish; source calls use the executing object's constant base. Slots publish the raw memory entry last with Release and generated readers use atomic Acquire-or-stronger loads. Optional short calls and rest-list marshaling stay on the shim; explicit `NEOVM_JIT_REG_ABI=on` restores the existing register path and shape reach. No native signature or slot-layout change. Read at compile time and slot arming; `=off` preserves existing direct-call CLIF verbatim (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_VARS` | `read` (unset); `=all`, or a comma list of `read`, `set`, `bind` | Variable ops inline in JIT code (`compile::inline_vars`, design `p1-4-inline-binding-blv` Stage B), each the cache-hit prefix of a Rust tier with the unchanged shim as its slow path. `read`: `varref` of a plain cell from its baked address, of a buffer-local variable whose cache is loaded for the current buffer, and of a forwarder's own slot. `set`: `varset` of those three (not for a projected symbol; a buffer-local one only into the buffer's own binding or a non-`local_if_set` default). `bind`: `varbind` and `unbind` (up to 4 bindings) of those three, writing the specpdl entries from the probed templates. Every guard precedes every store, and a store takes the shim during a concurrent mark or owner tracking. Read at compile time; `read` is the default, `set` and `bind` remain opt-in; `=off` emits the former code exactly (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_SITES` | `unbounded` | With direct calls on, which callers emit direct sites (`compile::DirectSitesMode`): `unbounded` (default) only a body that loops or calls itself, or a re-tier of one that proved hot -- a direct site costs its caller's compile about a hundred IR instructions and fourteen blocks more than a shim call, which a straight-line body entered a few thousand times never pays back (elb-bytecomp); `all` every body. Opt-in `self` emits only exact required-only named calls of the caller's own materialized source, with frameless unpatched bodies. It suppresses the implicit global register conversion: only a body with an actual surviving named self-call in its selected baseline/MIR site map gets register ABI, unless `REG_ABI=on` explicitly retains global reach. Self sites use the original register protocol independently of `DIRECT_MEMORY`; source/constant and optional/rest/framed self direct calls decline. Compiler source tokens are immutable scoped facts, never runtime Lisp caches; Release publication pairs with atomic Acquire-or-stronger self-site entry loads. Native signatures and slot layout stay unchanged. Read at compile time and slot arming. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_SHAPES` | off; `=all`/`=on`, or a comma list of `optional`, `rest`, `constant`, `framed` | With `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_CALL=on`, the call shapes beyond a named exact-arity call that direct sites take (P1.1 Stage 2, P1.0 S2.5; `compile::direct_call`). `optional` (2a): a named call of an `&optional` callee (the call fills or lacks its optional slots) passes nil in the registers of the missing ones, and `&optional` bodies take the register ABI. `rest` (2d): a named call of a `&rest` callee (at most 8 arguments) conses the rest list inline after the site's checks and passes it in the last register, and `&rest` bodies take the register ABI; the hit path also checks the slot's key says the leaf takes the call through a list. Both record the call's own arguments in the frame, as GNU's `Bcall` does, and their slow path `neovm_jit_direct_slow` runs `neovm_jit_call_spec` then arms the entry for the site's shape (`spec_slot::arm_shaped_direct_entry`). `constant` (2b): an `Op::Call` whose callee is a constant byte-code object the fuser left a call (a `cl-flet` local, a `lambda` literal) called with exactly its required parameters becomes a source site of the object's own source (`SpecCalleeKind::Constant`): a direct call through the source slot machinery (leaf-slot epoch, frame recording the object), `neovm_jit_call_source_spec` its slow path, the generic call its decline; a callee the lowering cannot prove constant is guarded by its bits. `framed` (2c): exact required-only JIT callees with bindings or handlers keep the memory ABI (named calls up to 8 arguments, source/object calls up to 6). The site pushes the original frame and increments depth inline, then enters `neovm_jit_direct_framed` through the gated lazy shim table; that contained trampoline owns every frame/depth cleanup and preserves boxed precise deoptimization. Slots publish a framed tag after leaf/key initialization with Release; generated framed readers use an atomic Acquire-or-stronger load. AOT sidecars and framed optional/rest marshaling stay on the reference path. Read at compile time and when a body's ABI is decided; unset/`off` is CLIF-identical (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_CALL_CENSUS` | off | `=on`: a measurement mode. Every JIT `Op::Call`/`Op::Apply` site first calls `neovm_jit_call_census`, which counts the call by site kind (`named` spec site, `const` callee, other `value`, `apply` of a function) and callee shape (`exact_direct`, `exact`, `optional_direct`, `optional`, `rest_direct`, `rest`, `framed`, `unarmed`, `declined`, `other`) read from the slot or the callee's armed leaf (`compile::call_census`); the counts print as `call-census:` in `[neovm-jit-final-builtin-leaves]` under `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS=1`. Named spec calls select `neovm_jit_call_spec_census`, whose exact accepted-fast counters print as `spec-shim-fast:armed=N,framed=N`; framed includes AOT sidecars. These counters decide Stage 2c, with direct calls off so the denominator covers all named fast entries. The earlier shape cells describe candidates before guards and count bindings/handlers as `framed`. Do not time runs with it on. Read at compile time; off is CLIF-identical and the ordinary spec shim has no runtime census branch. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_SWITCH` | on | Answer a `switch` jump table whose keys are immediates (nil, t, fixnums, symbols) or cons trees of them -- `pcase` symbol, fixnum and backquote patterns -- inline, behind the table's mutation epoch, with `neovm_jit_switch` as the slow path (`compile/switch_dispatch.rs`); `=off` calls the shim at every switch, CLIF-identical to the lowering before inline dispatch (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_MIR_REACH` | `=dead` (or `all`) | MIR reach admissions (design `p2-5-mir-reach`; the only legacy-MIR bit is `dead`, the others belong to the opt tier). `dead`: the MIR builder skips a block leader no path reaches (the `Return` `seal_ops` appends after a named-let's or `cl-loop`'s final `goto`) instead of bailing the body as `mir-unreachable-block`. Tier-up compiles only (AOT and inline callees never use it). Read at compile time; unset/`off` bails exactly as before (single-build A/B). Census: `reach_dead=`/`dead_leaders=` in the `mir[...]` summary. Blocker: F-R1 (P2.5 §7): admitted bodies must be at parity with the baseline. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_EQ_PREFILTER` | on | Answer native `eq`/`symbolp` inline unless an operand is a veclike (a symbol-with-pos is one); `=off` calls `neovm_jit_eq_slow`/`neovm_jit_symbolp_slow` for every mismatch/non-symbol (single-build A/B). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_COLD_EXITS` | on (unset); `=off`, `=share` | Mark every exit block cold in both tiers (`compile::cold_exits`, P2.2 O0.2): precise-deopt and rerun blocks, the shared signal exit and per-site handler dispatches, the back-edge poll's slow path and the root-window grow calls, so Cranelift emits them after the hot code instead of between hot blocks. `share` also sends every precise-deopt block of a function through one cold tail that writes the pc/depth/handler cells and returns (each site keeps only its framestate spill). Read at compile time; unset/`off` marks nothing new, CLIF-identical (single-build A/B of all three). Census: `cold_exits[deopt= rerun= signal= dispatch= poll= grow= deopt_tail=]` in the `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS=1` summary. Graduation: same-binary neutral or better on the six rows and org (P2.0 T0.3). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_BG` | `=sync`, `=on`, `=auto` | Where a JIT compile's backend (Cranelift codegen, register allocation, finalize) runs (`jit/bg.rs`, P2.4). `legacy`: the persistent module defines each leaf in place, as before. `sync`: the front/backend split run in line -- the front packages its finished function with its imports named by shim (`compile::shared::split`) and the eval thread's backend compiles it at once; deterministic, identical machine code. `on` (x86-64 Linux; elsewhere `sync`): entry tier-ups (dispatch, deferral expiry) hand the package to a worker thread `neovm-jit-0` with a backend and code arena of its own; the function stays interpreted (probing with a 32..1024-call backoff) until its leaf is installed at a probe on the eval thread, and every other compile runs as under `sync`. The compile stall (`total_us`) is then the front only. Counters: `[neovm-jit-final-bg]` (enqueued/installed/discarded by reason, backend and queue µs, install latency, probes, in-flight at exit, worker jobs/panics/code bytes). `auto`: `on` when the process's affinity has at least two CPUs, else `sync`. Read once per process. Companions (read once): `NEOVM_JIT_BG_THREADS` (1; clamped to 1..=min(4, CPUs-1)); `NEOVM_JIT_BG_QUEUE` (256 jobs) and `NEOVM_JIT_BG_QUEUE_INSTS` (1M CLIF instructions): a full queue drops its lowest-class, newest job (its function asks again once its heat doubled) or refuses a new one before its front, as does an eval thread holding 512 pending compiles; `NEOVM_JIT_BG_CLASSES=osr,first_sight,entry,upgrade` (default all) limits which compiles defer (`entry` alone is P2.4 B7); `NEOVM_JIT_BG_NICE=<n>` and `NEOVM_JIT_BG_AFFINITY=<cpu>[,<cpu>]` place the workers (measurement); `NEOVM_JIT_BG_STRESS=1` is the soak harness (each worker job starts 0-2 ms late and each finished job reads as running for 1-4 more probes, seeded by its sequence number). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_GATE_RELAX` | `=on` | Relax the calls ≤ arith profit gate. Default-on was tried and REVERTED (regressed byte-compile 21%) — measure byte-compile before ever re-flipping. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LEAF` | `opcode,bcall,string` (unset); `=all`/`=on` adds the default-off parts; `=off`, or a comma list of `opcode`, `bcall`, `string`, `vars`, `batch` | Leaf builtins (design `p1-2-builtin-intrinsics`, `compile/leaf_abi.rs`). `opcode`: `Op::Get/Length/Nth/Nthcdr/Elt/Member/Equal/StringEqual/StringLessp` sites call their leaf's bare trampoline (register args, the result's bits or a tag-`001` sentinel) instead of the `neovm_jit_builtin1/2` table shim. `bcall`: an `Op::Call` site speculated on `gethash`, `plist-get` or `get-char-property` (any symbol bound to them) calls the leaf's Bcall trampoline: a guard (no pending quit/signal/profiler tick/throw-on-input, no compiler overrides, not `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_SLOW_SPEC`, no `debug-on-next-call`, depth below the limit, the function cell unchanged) then the leaf, with no frame on success; a signal pushes GNU's `Bcall` frame lazily (`neovm_jit_leaf_signal_frame`) before dispatch; any guard miss or declined shape runs today's `neovm_jit_call_subr_spec` protocol. `string`: `aref` of a unibyte or all-ASCII multibyte string reads the byte inline (I1), and `aset` stores a same-width byte into owned string storage inline behind the `aset` redefinition gate (I2); every other shape calls `neovm_jit_aref`/`neovm_jit_aset` as before. `vars` (default off): `Op::SymbolValue` sites call the `symbol-value` leaf's bare trampoline and `Op::Call` sites on `buffer-local-value` its armed one; both are their references' bodies; `buffer-local-value` answers a buffer-local variable loaded for the current buffer through P1.4 Stage A's `Context::read_var_cached`. `batch` (default off): `Op::Call` sites on the first leaf batch -- `assoc` (a TESTFN bounces), `rassq`, `delq`, `copy-sequence`, `symbol-name`, `boundp`, `keywordp` -- call their armed trampolines. Read at compile time only. `opcode,bcall,string` default ON since the F-B gate passed (dhrystone -18% instructions, elb-eieio -4.7%, pack-unpack -4%, board org-editing -1%, no row worse); `=off` emits the former code exactly (single-build A/B). Exit census: `[neovm-jit-final-builtin-leaves]` under `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS=1`. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FEEDBACK` | `=record`, `=use` | P2.1 C3/C4 call-target feedback (`jit/feedback.rs`, `compile/call_feedback.rs`): `record` makes the interpreter's `Op::Call` record the targets of the body's NON-constant call sites (a callee that is a variable or a closure, the function an `apply` spreads into, the callback of `mapc`/`mapcar`/`mapcan`/`mapconcat`) into the source's call-site table (a symbol, up to 4 closure sources, or megamorphic; closure instances of one source are one target), compiled code record and count them through the JIT-only `neovm_jit_call_prof`/`_apply_prof`/`_record_call_target` shims for a site's first 15,000 counted executions (its profiling window; after it the shim is a count test and a tail call), and the exit report adds `[neovm-jit-final-calls]` (the census: sites by shape and state, executions, the stability window's late transitions) under `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS`. `census`: `record` with no window (every compiled call records, so the census sees transitions after the window: a measurement mode). `use`: the interpreter records and compiles read the targets (`NEOVM_JIT_SPEC_SOURCES` implies it); compiled sites do not record (no tier reads their feedback yet). Unset/`off`: nothing recorded, the interpreter's `Op::Call` pays one field compare as before and the lowering is CLIF-identical (single-build A/B). `NEOVM_JIT_CALL_FEEDBACK=on` is an alias of `record`. Blocker: F-1 R1 (recording tax <= 0.3% instructions on every row). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_SPEC_SOURCES` | `=on` | P2.1 C5 closure source slots (`compile/source_slots.rs`): a baseline T1 or OSR compile turns an `Op::Call` whose callee is not a constant and whose recorded target (`NEOVM_JIT_FEEDBACK`, which `on` raises to `use`) is ONE closure source into a guarded call: the callee's source identity (its `runtime` word, `jit_layout::BYTECODE_RUNTIME_WORD_OFFSET`) against the recorded source's, then `neovm_jit_call_source_spec` -- the spec shim's fast path on the source's armed leaf with the instance's own constant base and a frame recording the called object -- which answers `STATUS_NEED_GENERIC` for anything it declines; a miss or a decline runs the site's generic call, so the site never deopts. `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_SLOW_SPEC=1` declines every call. With `NEOVM_JIT_DIRECT_CALL=on` the shim arms the slot with the source's register entry (exact arity, frameless) and the site then enters the leaf itself (the named direct call's checks, with the leaf-slot epoch in place of the function epoch, a frame recording the called object, the instance's own constant base as `aux`), the shim being its slow path. Read at compile time; unset/`off` builds no source site, CLIF-identical (single-build A/B). Blocker: F-1 R2 (closure kernel >= -25%, and eieio <= -1.5% or org <= -0.5% or pack-unpack <= -1%). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_TIER2` | off | `on` enables the tier spine: entry countdown, cold-poll and window-only HOF credit, bounded feedback stability, compile CPU budget and worthwhile upgrades. Fast leaves may re-tier to Full; stable hot loop/recursive or feedback-call leaves may rebuild through the existing backend with feedback. The old native leaf serves pending background jobs; feedback upgrades retain T1 for counted deopt reversion. Off preserves the heat-driven re-tier and generated CLIF. Default remains off until F-W and compile-cost gates pass. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_WINDOW` | 15000 | First T1 work window under `TIER2=on`, counted by entries plus cold-poll and HOF credit. Read at compile time. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_LOOP_CREDIT` | 64 | Under `NEOVM_JIT_TIER2` (W1): what one back-edge poll tick (255 taken back edges) takes from the countdown, so a loop leaf requests after about 60k iterations; the mapping-builtin credit is `len / 64` per call. `0` = entry-only: no poll credit and no mapping-builtin credit. Read at compile time. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_STABLE` | 4000 | Work units with unchanged feedback after the first request or a T2 revert. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_ATTEMPTS` | 4 | Changed snapshots rearm at most this many windows, then only the existing full-allocator re-tier remains admissible. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_BUDGET` | 2 (%) | Per-mutator compile CPU allowance as a share of thread CPU; `0` is unlimited. In-flight upgrades reserve their estimate. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_BUDGET_FLOOR_MS` | 5 | Initial compile CPU allowance in milliseconds, added to the proportional budget. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_MAX_REOPT` | 3 | Counted feedback-upgrade invalidations per source before further feedback upgrades are banned. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_T2_STRESS` | off | `1`/`on`: first and stable windows become one, with an unlimited compile budget. Requires `TIER2=on`. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INTRINSICS` | off; `=on`/`=all`, or a comma list of `length`, `nth`, `memq`, `symbol-value` | CLIF intrinsics for leaf builtins (design `p1-2-builtin-intrinsics` §2.7, `compile/intrinsics.rs`), each an inline PREFIX of its opcode site whose miss falls through to the site's usual call (leaf trampoline, value shim or table shim), never to a deopt. `length` (I3): nil, a proper list of at most 64 conses (a bounded walk), a string, a plain vector or record. `nth` (I4): `nth`/`nthcdr`/`elt` of a list at a constant index 0..4, unrolled. `memq` (I5): `memq`/`assq`, and `member` with a fixnum or bare-symbol key, over the first 16 conses by bit identity, only while `symbols-with-pos-enabled` is off. `symbol-value` (I6): a bare symbol whose value cell is plain and bound (the `Op::VarRef` inline read; a nil value is refused unless the symbol is a known constant that is not a dedicated buffer-local). JIT only; read at compile time; unset/`off` emits the former code exactly (single-build A/B). Census: `intrinsic-<name>:inline_sites=` in `[neovm-jit-final-builtin-leaves]`. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LEAF_EFFECTS` | off; `=on` | MIR leaf effects (design `p1-2-builtin-intrinsics` §2.8, commit 11): an opcode site that calls a leaf builtin's body -- its trampoline, the `memq`/`assq` value shims or a pure table entry -- and whose lowering is GC-free (`calls::opcode_site_effects`: the leaf's declared `Effects`, which exclude MAY_GC, MAY_REENTER and MAY_DEOPT; the inline-lowered `aref`/`setcar`/`setcdr` are excluded, measured slower in MIR) no longer keeps a looping body out of the MIR tier (`gate:loop-opaque:<Op>`), and inside a MIR leaf it is no safepoint: the values live across it stay raw and unrooted (`mir_force_tagged` is skipped). JIT only; read at compile time; unset/`off` admits and lowers exactly as before (single-build A/B). The census is the MIR bail keys of `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS=1`. |
//! | `NEOVM_REGEX_ANCHOR_ALT` | on (`=off` disables) | P3.3 Stage 0 (`text/regex/emacs.rs` `start_anchor`): a regexp whose every alternative begins with `^` (or `` \` ``) searches line starts (or position 0) only; read when a pattern compiles. Default ON since the board A/B (org-editing -1.4% instructions). |
//! | `NEOVM_REGEX_DFA` | on (`=off` disables, `=verify`) | P3.3 existence DFA (`text/regex/dfa.rs`): `re_search` skips candidates the DFA rejects, `syntax-table` property runs and the lazy-propertize frontier included; `verify` also runs the matcher on every candidate and reports contradicted verdicts. `NEOVM_REGEX_DFA_STATS=1` prints the filter's counters (`[neovm-regex-dfa]`) at exit. Default ON since the F1′ replay and the board A/B (C8, U3.1). |
//! | `NEOVM_FN_STAMPS` | off; `=on`/`=1` | P1.3 A1 per-symbol function-binding stamps (`symbol/fn_stamps.rs`): function-cell writes stamp their symbol, and subr rewrites, compiler-overrides changes, and dump restore raise a floor. `Obarray::fn_unchanged_since(sym, E)` proves that binding unchanged after unrelated clock moves. Stamps are always written; off makes the predicate false. Read once per process; no CLIF change. S2.7 F1 confirmed leaf-resolution savings but failed the load-cycle gate; A3/A4 consumers remain parked, so this knob currently enables only the validity predicate. |
//!
//! ## Measurement / bisection
//! | Knob | Meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_MAX_ID` | Compile only functions with id ≤ N (ids assigned in first-hot order) — clean prefix bisection of a misbehaving workload. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DEBUG_ID` | Dump the bytecode body of the one compiled function with this id. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_PROFILE` | Append per-function workload-characterization records to this file path: one CSV row per compile attempt (its last three columns are `compiled_id,tier,name`), each followed by a `#mir,compiled_id,verdict` row (why the MIR tier did or did not take the body: `taken`, the pre-build gates such as `gate_opt+gate_prefix`, or the first bail key the census counted; `-` when the compile never reached the MIR tier; see `stats::verdict`), and at exit one `#leaf,compiled_id,name,tier,osr_pc,entries,deopt_at,deopt_rerun,signals,top_deopt_pc` row per compiled leaf, joinable on `compiled_id`. Also turns on per-leaf entry counting and per-function names (see `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS`). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS` | `=1`: print a running compile-stall summary line every 64 compiles (and every 50,000 dispatch consultations), plus a final `[neovm-jit-final*]` report when the command loop returns (`kill-emacs`, end of `--batch`, batch-error exit 255; not on death by signal). The final report separates the session from startup (`since_command_loop`), counts `function_epoch` bumps by reason, and prints per-leaf deopt/signal/entry counts, compile µs and MIR verdict (`mir=`, as in `NEOVM_JIT_PROFILE`'s `#mir` rows) (`[neovm-jit-final-leaf]`: the most-deopting leaves, then the most-entered, then the costliest remaining compiles). Every compile is also split by why it ran and where its time went (`[neovm-jit-phases]` every 64 compiles, `[neovm-jit-final-phases]` at exit: `origin[dispatch=count/ok/µs,...]` over dispatch, deferral_expired, retier, first_sight, osr, aot_drain; `phase_us[gate,mir_build,fuse,lower,setup,codegen,finalize,other]`, exclusive, summing to the metered stall; see `stats::phases`). The phase split reads the clock only under this knob; the origin rows are always kept. The persistent JIT backend's counters print as `[neovm-jit-final-code-memory]` (leaves per backend, modules created/retired, re-entrant fallbacks, arena regions/pages/code bytes/seals). Under this knob (or `NEOVM_JIT_STATS_FILE`/`NEOVM_JIT_PROFILE`) every JIT leaf compiled from then on also carries a native-entry counter in its prologue (a load, an add and a store: expect call-heavy code to run slightly slower, so do not time runs with a report knob on) and a per-function entry name. With every report knob off the generated code has no counter. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_STATS_FILE` | `=<path>`: append every `[neovm-jit-*]` report line to this file instead of stderr (an unopenable path falls back to stderr). Setting it implies `NEOVM_JIT_COMPILE_STATS=1`. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_SIZE_UNIT` | Override [`RuntimeState::SIZE_UNIT`] (512): the ops-per-unit divisor scaling the tier-up threshold by body size. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_MAX_OPS` | Override [`RuntimeState::MAX_TIER_OPS`] (4096): largest body that tiers at all; `0` = uncapped (the mid-end campaign's acceptance configuration). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REGALLOC` | Force one Cranelift register allocator for every JIT compile: `backtracking` (regalloc2 ion) or `single_pass` (fastalloc). Unset = the policy in `lowering::choose_regalloc` (fast for straight-line bodies, full for loops/OSR, re-tier when hot). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REGALLOC_SMALL_MAX` | Bytecode-op cap for using the full (backtracking) allocator regardless of body shape; default `0` preserves today's allocator policy and CLIF. The forced `NEOVM_JIT_REGALLOC` choice takes precedence; larger bodies keep the original rule. Read once per process, before lowering and ISA selection, including the MIR tier. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_PROFIT_DEFER` | Override [`RuntimeState::PROFIT_DEFER_FACTOR`] (4): a body the profitability gate refuses tiers up anyway at `factor × hot_threshold()` calls (`0` = never, the former veto). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_RETIER_FACTOR` | Override [`RuntimeState::RETIER_FACTOR`] (16): a fast-allocator leaf is rebuilt with the full allocator at `factor × hot_threshold()` heat; `0` = never. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REGALLOC_CHECKER=1` | Run regalloc2's checker after every allocation (verification harness for the allocator choice). |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_MEMQ_STEPS` | `=<1..64>`: the bound of `NEOVM_JIT_INTRINSICS=memq`'s inline walk (default 16), for measurement. Read at compile time. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_LEAF_ONLY` | `=<name>,<name>` (the builtins' Lisp names, e.g. `nth,gethash`): restrict `NEOVM_JIT_LEAF`'s sites to these leaves -- per-builtin measurement and bisection. Unset = every leaf. Read at compile time. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DUMP_CLIF` | `=<path>`: append every lowered function's CLIF to this file, each under a `;; baseline\|mir ... entry=<declared name>` header (the IR-composition census). Turns per-function entry names on, so `entry=` names the Lisp function. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_DUMP_ASM` | `=<path>`: append the final machine code of every JIT leaf (baseline, MIR, OSR) to this file: a `;; ==== <label> name= id= tier= addr= size= regalloc= clif_insts=` header, Cranelift's post-register-allocation disassembly (physical registers, spill/reload moves; `Context::set_disasm`, requested only under this knob), and the finalized code bytes in hex (`xxd -r -p \| objdump -D -b binary -mi386:x86-64 --adjust-vma=<addr>` recovers exact offsets for a perf `sym+offset`). Turns per-function entry names on. Compile-time only; unset = no disassembly work at all. |
//! | `PERF_BUILDID_DIR` | Not ours: `perf record -- cmd` sets it, and cranelift-jit then appends every defined function to `/tmp/perf-<pid>.map`. It also turns on per-function entry names: each JIT leaf is declared as `lisp:<fn>#<id>:baseline\|mir\|osr@<pc>` instead of the shared `__neovm_jit_leaf`/`__neovm_mir_leaf`, so perf attributes JIT samples per Lisp function (`<fn>` is the called symbol, else `anon[<first symbol constants>]`). For `perf record -p` on a running editor, start neomacs with `PERF_BUILDID_DIR=/tmp`. Names are also on under `NEOVM_JIT_DUMP_CLIF` and any report knob. Only the declared name changes; the code is identical. |
//!
//! ## Verification harnesses (force the cold path everywhere; run the suite with each ON)
//! | Knob | Forces |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_INLINE_CENSUS` | off; `=1` records P2.3 candidate sites at compile attempts and bytecode callbacks entered through `apply1_bytecode`, with source/target rows at exit and callback counts since command-loop entry. Read once per process; no generated code changes. Measurement-only: remove after the inlining policy is qualified; keep off during performance gates. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_DEOPT=1` | Every speculation guard fails → every deopt path executes. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_SLOW_SPEC=1` | Every spec-call shim takes its stale-epoch re-validate branch on every call. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_CBSYM_GENERIC=1` | Every CallBuiltinSym intrinsic bounces to its generic fallback. |
//! | `NEOVM_JIT_REOPT_STRESS=1` | Deopt reoptimization at its most eager: site limit 1, re-profile window 1, `MAX_REOPTS` 1, so every source climbs the whole `ReoptLevel` ladder. `NEOVM_JIT_FORCE_DEOPT=1` alone makes reoptimization inert (else it would widen every site to generic and stop exercising the deopt paths); with this knob too it drives every source up the ladder. |
//!
//! ## AOT (`jit/aot.rs`)
//! | Knob | Meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `NEOVM_AOT` | `1`/`on`/`force` enables the AOT preload; `force` additionally warns when no usable preload loaded. |
//! | `NEOVM_AOT_RETIER` | Default off. `1`/`on` replaces AOT leaves with JIT code at `NEOVM_JIT_RETIER_FACTOR × NEOVM_JIT_THRESHOLD` heat, including cached native calls. T2 requests use the tier spine; otherwise the existing heat trigger applies. Pending upgrades keep serving native AOT; refused upgrades keep it without repeated requests. `RETIER_FACTOR=0` or a forced allocator disables this upgrade. |
//! | `NEOVM_AOT_PGO` | `1`/`on`/`force` enables PGO collection for the AOT function set. |
//! | `NEOVM_AOT_PREWARM` | `profitable` (default): of the preload's members only the manifest's `m` class (bodies the JIT's profit gate would compile) runs native from call 1; `c` call glue is served when the JIT would compile it, replacing that compile (P4.2 A4). `all`: every member from call 1, as before (single-build A/B). |
