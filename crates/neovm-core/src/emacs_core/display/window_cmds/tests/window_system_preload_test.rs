//! Standing check: which of GNU's window-system preloads does this build take?
//!
//! GNU's `lisp/loadup.el` splits the graphical preloads in two, and the split
//! is not cosmetic -- the two halves answer two different questions about the
//! build:
//!
//! 1. **"Is there a window system at all?"**  `lisp/loadup.el:291-299`
//!    (`(if (fboundp 'x-create-frame) (progn (load "fringe") (load
//!    "emacs-lisp/regexp-opt") (load "image") (load
//!    "international/fontset") (load "dnd") (load "tool-bar")))`).
//!    `x-create-frame` is `DEFUN`ed in `src/xfns.c`, `src/pgtkfns.c`,
//!    `src/nsfns.m`, `src/haikufns.c`, `src/androidfns.c` and `src/w32fns.c`,
//!    i.e. once per window system, so `fboundp` here is GNU's Lisp-level
//!    spelling of `HAVE_WINDOW_SYSTEM`.
//! 2. **"WHICH window system?"**  `lisp/loadup.el:304-362`, six sibling
//!    branches on `(featurep 'x)`, `'haiku`, `'android`, `'w32`, `'ns` and
//!    `'pgtk`.  Each provides its own `term/FOO-win.el`, and **every one of
//!    the six also loads `term/common-win.el`** -- the file whose name says
//!    what it is.  The only branch that skips it is `ms-dos`, and it says why
//!    in a comment: "Don't load term/common-win: it isn't appropriate for the
//!    `pc' ``window system'', which generally behaves like a terminal"
//!    (`lisp/loadup.el:341-343`).
//!
//! This port answers **yes** to (1): `x-create-frame` is registered, and
//! `loadup.el` takes that branch exactly as GNU does.  It answers **none** to
//! (2): there is no `neo` branch, because `term/neo-win.el` is a GUI-runtime
//! concern (it opens with `(unless (featurep 'neomacs) (error ...))`, and
//! `neomacs` is not provided in a dumped batch image).
//!
//! Measured over the 1972 names of ledger 178's deleted seed tables, against
//! GNU Emacs 31.0.90 `-Q --batch` built three ways -- `--with-x-toolkit=gtk3`,
//! `--without-x --without-all`, and this port:
//!
//! | `documentation-property` answers | GNU+X | GNU tty-only | neomacs | n |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | | doc | doc | doc | 1856 |
//! | question (1)'s files | doc | **nil** | **doc** | **77** |
//! | question (2)'s files | doc | nil | nil | **28** |
//! | names GNU 31 no longer documents | nil | nil | nil | 11 |
//!
//! The 77 row is the load-bearing one: on every variable that separates a
//! tty-only GNU from a graphical one, **this port answers with the graphical
//! build.**  It is not a tty build, so "the tty build skips `common-win` too"
//! is not available as a defence for skipping it here.
//!
//! Ledger 179.

/// The last three rows are the gain; the first three are the price, and the
/// first two are why this is a decline rather than a landing.  No GNU
/// `term/FOO-win.el` contains a `define-minor-mode` -- the only two `term/`
/// files that do are `tvi970.el` and `vt100.el`, which are TTY files loaded at
/// runtime and never dumped -- so no GNU dump has `easy-mmode`.  This port's
/// `term/neo-win.el` has two, at `:514` and `:538`, and they sit inside a
/// 305-line block of renderer knobs (`:420`-`:724` of 728) that GNU's
/// window-system files have no counterpart for.  And `window-system` non-nil
/// in a batch image is the recurring "invented Rust default" of this campaign
/// wearing a new hat: `crates/neovm-core/src/emacs_core/lisp/load/mod.rs:4627-4637` derives it
/// from `(featurep 'neomacs)`, so providing the feature at dump time makes a
/// batch session claim a GUI.
///
/// What the price actually costs a caller was measured rather than assumed.
/// Over eight window-system predicates -- `window-system`,
/// `display-graphic-p`, `display-multi-frame-p`, `display-popup-menus-p`,
/// `framep-on-display`, `(and window-system t)`, the frame's `window-system`
/// parameter and `noninteractive` -- GNU+X, GNU `--without-x` and this build
/// all answer `(nil nil nil nil t nil nil t)` in `--batch`.  The prototype
/// answers `(neo nil nil nil t t nil t)`: **one** row moves, and it is the one
/// every `(if window-system ...)` in Elisp reads.
///
/// And the reason this is pinned here rather than left to a suite: the
/// prototype passes the ORACLE suite.  `38815 tests run: 38812 passed, 3
/// failed`, and the three are the pre-existing upstream window-scroll trio.
/// Thirty-eight thousand agreement rows do not see any of the four costs
/// above, which is the brief's false-green law in its structural form -- so
/// the decline rests on direct measurement against GNU, and this test is what
/// carries it.
///
/// Ledger 189.  This test pins a state that is NOT GNU parity on two rows, and
/// says so: `display-format-alist` and the `[drag-n-drop]` binding are things
/// GNU's dump has and this one does not.  It exists so the decline cannot
/// drift -- flipping `(featurep 'neomacs)` at dump time turns it red, and
/// whoever does that has to read this entry first.  RED under the prototype,
/// which is the negative control for every row above:
///
/// ```text
/// left:  "OK (t t t neo neo ((\".*\" . neo)) neomacs-drag-n-drop t t)"

/// question".  Ledger 189 owns it, and the first thing to say is that ten was
/// a third of the number.
///
/// GNU answers the question in source, without needing a build.  Take the

/// `xterm.c`/`xfns.c`, `pgtkterm.c`/`pgtkfns.c`, `haikuterm.c`/`haikufns.c`,
/// `androidterm.c`/`androidfns.c`, `w32term.c`/`w32fns.c`,
/// `nsterm.m`/`nsfns.m` -- and split X's 62 `x-`-prefixed ones by whether any
/// *other* backend also declares them.  It comes out 31/31:
///
/// * **31 shared** -- the keysym five (`x-ctrl-keysym` ... `x-super-keysym`),
///   `x-toolkit-scroll-bars`, `x-underline-at-descent-line`,
///   `x-use-underline-position-properties`, `x-cursor-fore-pixel`,
///   `x-max-tooltip-size`, the pointer shapes, the window-edge cursors.
///   These are what "having a window system" means, and `src/pgtkterm.c:7449`
///   -`7494` is GNU declaring exactly that subset for a GUI backend that is
///   not X.  This build binds **29** of the 31 (`x-mode-pointer-shape` and
///   `x-nontext-pointer-shape` are the two it leaves out).
/// * **31 X-only** -- the ten `x-dnd-*`, the Motif and XDND protocol knobs,
///   `x-keysym-table`, `x-input-coding-system`/`-function`, `x-quit-keysym`,
///   `x-detect-server-trust`, `x-fast-protocol-requests`,
///   `x-allow-focus-stealing`, `x-lax-frame-positioning`,
///   `x-auto-preserve-selections`, `x-scroll-event-delta-factor`, the four
///   `x-gtk-*` ones in `xterm.c`, and the rest.  GNU compiles these only
///   inside `#ifdef HAVE_X_WINDOWS` (`src/emacs.c:2373-2375`), which is the
///   same `#ifdef` that runs `Fprovide (Qx, Qnil)` (`src/xfns.c:10498`).
///   **This build binds 31 of 31.**
///
/// GNU says the same thing a second time in preloaded Lisp, which is the
/// sharper citation because it is a table rather than an inference.
/// `lisp/cus-start.el` decides whether a missing C variable is an error by
/// asking a per-name `native-p` question, and it separates the two cases
/// explicitly: `scroll-bar-adjust-thumb-portion`,
/// `x-scroll-event-delta-factor`, `x-dnd-disable-motif-drag` and
/// `x-auto-preserve-selections` are gated on `(featurep 'x)`, while a generic
/// `x-` name is gated on `(fboundp 'x-create-frame)`.  That is GNU's own
/// spelling of question two versus question one, applied to the C surface.
///
/// **Not changed here, and the reason is a pin rather than an opinion.**
/// `crates/neovm-oracle-tests/src/defvar_bool_byte_boolean_vars.rs`'s
/// `oracle_every_defvar_bool_variable_is_bound_and_canonical` asserts that all
/// 147 of GNU's `DEFVAR_BOOL` names -- five `x-dnd-*` among them -- are bound
/// AND canonical here, and it agrees with GNU because the reference binary is
/// built with X.  Deleting the X-only declarations turns that agreement pin
/// red and replaces it with a hand-maintained exception list, which is the
/// shape ledger 176 caught being one GNU spelling away from silently wrong.
/// So the C surface is a *policy* this project has pinned against GNU+X, not
/// a leftover: changing it is a decision about what the oracle reference
/// means, and it belongs in its own entry with its own gates.
///
/// Ledger 189.  GREEN before and after; it exists so the 31 cannot drift in
/// either direction unnoticed, and so the next author finds GNU's own rule for
/// telling the two halves apart instead of re-deriving it.
