//! Image `:file` path resolution.
//!
//! GNU resolves an image spec's `:file` via `image_find_image_fd`, which runs
//! `openp` over a search path of `[data-directory/images, ...x-bitmap-file-path]`
//! (src/image.c). A relative name like `splash.svg` is therefore found under
//! `etc/images/`, not the process working directory. This module mirrors that
//! contract as one pure, testable resolver and one typed classification that
//! the evaluator thread and the off-thread image submission worker share, so
//! the two consumers can never drift out of sync.
