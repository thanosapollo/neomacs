//! Whether the pointer is currently holding a window edge, and which drag that is.
//!
//! Machinery with no elisp surface and no GNU `src/*.c` mirror: GNU has
//! nothing to record here because GNU's redisplay always installs instantly,
//! and only a compositor that animates between presentations has to know which
//! ones the user's hand is placing.
//!
//! The extent of a drag is the pointer button. A press that lands on a region
//! whose drag moves a window edge opens a session; releasing that button closes
//! it. That is a fact about the interaction rather than about Lisp:
//! `lisp/mouse.el`'s `mouse-drag-line` sets `track-mouse` to `dragging` and
//! installs a `set-transient-map`, then *returns*, so the drag runs one command
//! per pointer movement and there is no command extent to bind to — and
//! `track-mouse` itself is a `setq` convention of three particular commands,
//! which a rebound `[mode-line down-mouse-1]` would not follow.
