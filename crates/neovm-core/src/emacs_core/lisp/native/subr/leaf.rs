//! Leaf builtins: a second, effect-typed entry point for a builtin that
//! compiled code may call without the builtin-call protocol (design
//! `p1-2-builtin-intrinsics` §2.2).
//!
//! A leaf body is `fn(&Context, Value...) -> LeafResult`. The SHARED borrow is
//! the contract: every GC safe point (`maybe_gc`), the quit poll
//! (`maybe_quit`), every entry into Lisp (`funcall`, `eval`, `apply`), a
//! `specbind` and a condition-stack push all take `&mut Context`, so a leaf
//! cannot collect, cannot run Lisp and cannot start a nested activation --
//! checked by the compiler, not by a comment. That is what lets its call site
//! root nothing, push no frame and keep raw values in registers across the
//! call. The [`Effects`] bits are metadata on top of that proof: a wrong bit
//! can cost an optimization, never a use-after-free.
//!
//! A leaf may decline an argument shape whose reference behaviour needs Lisp
//! (a user-defined hash test, a `plist-get` predicate): it answers
//! [`LeafExit::Generic`] BEFORE any side effect, and the call site runs the
//! reference builtin from scratch.
//!
//! Two shapes, after GNU's two ways of reaching a primitive from bytecode:
//!
//! * [`LeafShape::Opcode`]: an inline opcode (`Bget`, `Blength`, `Bnth`, ...)
//!   calls the primitive directly, with no frame, depth count or quit poll.
//!   The leaf answers exactly as the interpreter's opcode arm does (for `nth`
//!   that is `Bnth`, whose error datum differs from `Fnth`'s), and compiled
//!   code finds it by opcode.
//! * [`LeafShape::Bcall`]: `Op::Call` on a symbol (GNU `Bcall`), which records
//!   a backtrace frame, counts depth and polls quit. The leaf answers exactly
//!   as the registered builtin does; it is attached to that builtin's
//!   [`SubrSpec`](super::SubrSpec) (`SubrSpec::leaf`) and found through the
//!   subr the call site's symbol is bound to. The call site proves the
//!   protocol unobservable before taking it (the JIT's Bcall guard) and
//!   records the frame lazily when the leaf signals.

// Only compiled code calls leaves: without the JIT they are declarations.
