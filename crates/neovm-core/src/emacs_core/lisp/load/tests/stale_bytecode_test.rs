//! Standing check: this build cannot read bytecode older than its source and
//! report what it found as behaviour.
//!
//! Generated `.elc` files are gitignored, so they do not travel with a pull, a
//! merge or a fresh worktree, and `load` prefers a `.elc` over a newer `.el`.
//! A tree whose `.el` moved and whose `.elc` did not therefore runs the OLD
//! bytecode, and any test asserting on the compiled result reports the old
//! behaviour -- as a failure that looks exactly like a code defect.  It has
//! done so four times in this campaign, and cost a peer session a day.
//!
//! GNU has two defences and this port had neither in force:
//!
//! 1. **`lisp/loadup.el:110-116`** (Bug#17629) is one `(if dump-mode (progn
//!    ...))` with two effective statements -- `(setq inhibit-load-charset-map
//!    t)` and `(setq load-prefer-newer t)`.  The second is what keeps stale
//!    bytecode out of the dumped image entirely.  This port runs loadup with
//!    `dump-mode' nil (`load.rs`, `set_loadup_dump_mode(..., None)`) because
//!    Rust, not Lisp, does the dumping -- so the branch is dead and both
//!    statements have to be seeded from Rust.  Before ledger 202 only the
//!    first one was: `eval.set_variable("inhibit-load-charset-map", Value::T)`
//!    sat two lines below, and its sibling was left behind the dead `if`.
//!    Half a block was hoisted.
//!
//! 2. **`src/lread.c:1368-1398`** stats the `.el` beside every `.elc` `Fload`
//!    opens and messages `"Source file `%s' newer than byte-compiled file;
//!    using older file"`.  That string did not exist anywhere in this port, so
//!    the wrong answer was also a silent one.
//!
//! The type-level point is ledger 173's law in a new place.  A predicate over
//! rows that exist cannot see a row never written -- and here the rows DO
//! exist: `bootstrap_source_fingerprint` already stats every `.el` and `.elc`
//! under `lisp/` to build the memo key.  Nothing ever asked that table which
//! `.elc` no longer implement their `.el`.  The verdict costs no I/O; it was
//! simply never derived.
//!
//! Ledger 202.
