//! Standing check: which names does THIS build declare as primitive subrs, and
//! the reference GNU build does not?
//!
//! This is DIVERGENCES.md 138's question -- *which build declares which name* --
//! asked of FUNCTIONS.  138 asked it of variables and answered it with
//! `cus_start_platform_vars.rs`, a table whose every row carries a measured
//! `GnuBinding`.  179 asked it of a window system's Lisp variables and answered
//! it with a `mapatoms` prefix scan in `window_system_preload_test.rs`.  This
//! file is the function-side third.
//!
//! ## Why a name may legitimately be here
//!
//! In GNU a subr's existence is a consequence of a C declaration standing
//! inside a `syms_of_*` that a build's `#ifdef` either compiles or does not, so
//! two GNU builds of the same source declare different names and neither is
//! wrong.  The reference build measured against this port is
//!
//! ```text
//! --with-native-compilation=no --with-tree-sitter --with-x-toolkit=gtk3
//! ```
//!
//! (`system-configuration-options`, GNU 31.0.90, mirror `0ee48ac4df2`), so it
//! compiles `xfns.c` and `dbusbind.c` and does NOT compile `xwidget.c`,
//! `comp.c`'s guarded body, `term.c`'s Gpm block, `ENABLE_CHECKING` or
//! `ITREE_DEBUG`.  A name this port declares because it really has the
//! capability GNU's `#ifdef` names is not a divergence; ledger 183 already
//! ruled that for the xwidget pair.
//!
//! There are exactly TWO admissible reasons, and they are the two variants of
//! [`WhyThisBuildDeclaresIt`].  Everything else this port used to declare was
//! one of three defects, and the type is shaped so that none of them can be
//! parked here as a data row (ledger 190 deleted 27 names on that reading):
//!
//! * **A capability this build does not have.**  `gpm-mouse-start` and
//!   `gpm-mouse-stop` are `#ifdef HAVE_GPM` (`src/term.c:5282-5286`) and this
//!   port links no libgpm -- and GNU's own `lisp/t-mouse.el:49` uses
//!   `(fboundp 'gpm-mouse-start)` as the test for "was Emacs built with Gpm",
//!   so declaring the name replaced GNU's "Emacs must be built with Gpm to use
//!   this mode" with a stub's "Gpm-mouse only works in the GNU/Linux console".
//!   The thirteen `comp`/`native-elisp-load` names are the same shape and
//!   bigger: GNU registers exactly ONE comp.c subr outside
//!   `#ifdef HAVE_NATIVE_COMP` -- `native-comp-available-p`
//!   (`src/comp.c:5828`, after the `#endif`) -- and this build answers `nil`
//!   to it, in agreement with the reference GNU.
//! * **A name no GNU build declares at all.**  `overlay-tree` is
//!   `#ifdef ITREE_DEBUG` (`src/buffer.c:5025`, `:6117`) and `ITREE_DEBUG` is
//!   defined nowhere in GNU's tree, so no configuration ships it; this port's
//!   was a `nil` stub.  `x-scroll-bar-foreground`, `x-scroll-bar-background`,
//!   `defining-kbd-macro-p` and `executing-kbd-macro-p` have zero occurrences
//!   anywhere in GNU's `src/` or `lisp/`.  `treesit-language-version` and
//!   `treesit-parser-changed-ranges` occur exactly ONCE each in the whole GNU
//!   tree, and it is a stale `declare-function` in GNU's own
//!   `lisp/treesit.el:72` and `:102` -- GNU renamed the first to
//!   `treesit-language-abi-version` and left the declaration behind.
//! * **A Rust reimplementation of Lisp this port already ships.**
//!   `kmacro-set-counter`, `kmacro-add-counter`, `kmacro-set-format`
//!   (`lisp/kmacro.el:285`, `:321`, `:339`) and `open-tls-stream`
//!   (`lisp/obsolete/tls.el:186`) were Rust subrs that this port's own `.el`
//!   overwrote the moment it loaded -- measured, `SUBR` before
//!   `(require 'kmacro)` and `LISP` after.  That is
//!   `rust_subrs_shadowed_by_lisp_test.rs`'s class in the half that test
//!   cannot see, because it scans only what `loadup.el` preloads and none of
//!   those four files is preloaded.
//!
//! ## Why the third test is a scan and not a list
//!
//! Ledger 173's law: a predicate over rows that exist cannot see a row that was
//! never written, so ask what the guard reports when the artifact is EMPTY.
//! Empty the table below and
//! `every_subr_gnus_c_has_no_defun_for_is_accounted_for` fails on the first
//! `neomacs-` name it meets, by name.  Green-when-empty is not reachable: the
//! measured side is a `mapatoms` over a booted runtime's obarray, which has no
//! empty state, and the table is only ever the *subtrahend*.
//!
//! `GNU_SUBR_DOCS` stands in for "the names GNU's `src/*.c` DEFUNs" because it
//! is generated from GNU's sources by a port of GNU's own `make-docfile` and
//! diffed byte-for-byte against the compiled binary (ledger 181).  It is a
//! table of *documented* DEFUNs, and a name can be a subr in BOTH editors and
//! still have no row in it -- GNU's `doc :` typo hides two real `treesit.c`
//! DEFUNs, and `lisp/subr.el`'s two `defalias`es of a subr OBJECT create two
//! function cells with no `DEFUN` of their own name at all.  Those four are
//! [`BOTH_EDITORS_DECLARE_IT`], with the mechanism per row; they are not
//! divergences and are deliberately kept out of
//! [`WhyThisBuildDeclaresIt`], which answers a different question.
//!
//! The scan below found all four on its first run, and a fifth that was a real
//! defect: **`defining-kbd-macro`.**  GNU's `lisp/help.el:356` is
//! `(fset 'defining-kbd-macro (symbol-function 'start-kbd-macro))`, commented
//! "So keyboard macro definitions are documented correctly", and this port
//! ships that exact line -- but also registered a separate Rust subr of that
//! name whose registration runs after loadup, so the `fset` was undone.
//! Measured before ledger 190 removed it:
//!
//! ```text
//! (subr-name (symbol-function 'defining-kbd-macro))   GNU "start-kbd-macro"  here "defining-kbd-macro"
//! (eq (symbol-function 'start-kbd-macro)
//!     (symbol-function 'defining-kbd-macro))          GNU t                  here nil
//! (documentation 'defining-kbd-macro)                 GNU "Record subsequent keyboard input, ..."
//!                                                                            here nil
//! ```
//!
//! -- which is the exact failure GNU's comment says the `fset` is there to
//! prevent.
//!
//! What this file deliberately does NOT decide is the `#ifdef` half: whether
//! the reference GNU compiles `xwidget.c` is a fact about a build that is not
//! in this repository.  Its guard is the oracle pin in
//! `crates/neovm-oracle-tests/src/subr_surface_build_differences.rs`, which boots both
//! editors and compares their obarrays to each other.
//!
//! Ledger 190.
