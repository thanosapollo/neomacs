//! Standing check: **this build ships no `.el` that GNU would have compiled.**
//!
//! Ledger 202 gave this tree a refusal for bytecode *older* than its source.
//! That predicate is keyed on the `.elc`: `stale_lisp_bytecode` walks the
//! `.elc` files and asks each one for its `.el`.  A `.el` with **no** `.elc`
//! never enters the loop, so the third state of a Lisp tree -- source present,
//! bytecode absent -- had no observer at all.  Ledger 173's law, and this time
//! the row that was never written is the whole defect.
//!
//! # What the absent `.elc` costs, precisely
//!
//! `Fload` hands a `*.el` to `load-source-file-function`, which `loadup.el:143`
//! sets to `load-with-code-conversion` (`src/lread.c:1400-1418`).  That
//! function inserts the file into a temporary buffer with
//! `insert-file-contents` (`lisp/international/mule.el:294-336`), and
//! `Finsert_file_contents` assigns `Vlast_coding_system_used`
//! (`src/fileio.c:5172`).  A `*.elc` never reaches that path: `Fload` falls
//! through to `readevalloop` over a raw stdio stream and touches no coding
//! state.
//!
//! Measured on both editors, two fixtures with identical bytes, one with a
//! `.elc` beside it and one without (ledger 207 §1):
//!
//! ```text
//!                    compiled arm            source-only arm
//! GNU Emacs 31.0.90  sentinel -> sentinel    sentinel -> prefer-utf-8-unix
//! neomacs            sentinel -> sentinel    sentinel -> prefer-utf-8-unix
//! ```
//!
//! So a generated file that ships without its `.elc` silently rewrites the
//! coding state of whatever called `load`.  A peer session lost months to
//! exactly that: `lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-loaddefs.el` had no `.elc`, the
//! missing-lexical-binding warning pulls `warnings` -> `icons` -> `cl-lib` ->
//! `cl-loaddefs` *inside* the load being measured, and
//! `oracle_load_auto_detects_iso_2022_source_without_a_valid_cookie` read the
//! clobbered value.
//!
//! # GNU's rule, and why it is not a list
//!
//! See [`compile_main_rule`] for the citation.  In one line: GNU's
//! `compile-main` compiles every `.el` it globs unless that file's own text
//! says `no-byte-compile: t`, and the generator is what decides whether a
//! generated file carries the cookie.  So this is a scan over the tree, not a
//! table of names -- for the same reason ledger 197's `c_features` scan reads
//! `features` out of a live runtime instead of grepping for `provide`, and the
//! same reason ledger 206's recipe check runs awk and diffs the bytes on disk.
//!
//! Ledger 207.
