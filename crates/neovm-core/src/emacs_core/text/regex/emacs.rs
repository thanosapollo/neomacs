//! GNU Emacs regex engine translated to Rust.
//!
//! This is a direct translation of GNU Emacs's `regex-emacs.c` — the same
//! algorithm, same bytecode format, same semantics.  The engine compiles
//! Emacs regex patterns to bytecode and executes them with syntax-table
//! awareness, backreference support, and POSIX backtracking.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Pattern string
//!     ↓
//! regex_compile()     →  CompiledPattern (bytecode + fastmap)
//!     ↓
//! re_search()         →  Find match position (uses fastmap for skipping)
//!     ↓
//! re_match_internal() →  Execute bytecode against text (backtracking)
//!     ↓
//! MatchRegisters      →  Group start/end positions
//! ```
//!
//! ## Reference
//!
//! - GNU source: `src/regex-emacs.c` (5355 lines)
//! - GNU header: `src/regex-emacs.h`
//! - GNU search: `src/search.c` (3514 lines)

/// - `ISPRINT(c)` for single-byte is `c >= ' '` AND NOT in

    // `c >= 256` (our `class_bits` / `mb_ranges`, the multibyte dispatch path).

// "threads" (each an NFA state = bytecode pc + capture slots) through the text
// one character at a time, in the SAME priority order the backtracker would
// explore.  Because every consuming test calls the SAME shared `match_*_at`
// helpers and the epsilon-closure follows splits fall-through-first (exactly
// mirroring the backtracker's "continue at the instruction, push the jump
// target as a failure point"), the Pike VM reproduces Emacs's leftmost-greedy
// captures BYTE-EXACTLY — while killing catastrophic backtracking (`a*a*b`
// becomes linear).
//
// Only patterns with `pike_eligible == true` reach here (no backreference, no
// `\{n,m\}` interval counters, not POSIX-longest).  See `compute_pike_eligible`.
