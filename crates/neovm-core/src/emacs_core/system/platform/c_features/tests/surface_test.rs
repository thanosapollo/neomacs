//! Standing check for the `Fprovide` half of a build option.
//!
//! Ledger 189 measured what one `#ifdef` decides in GNU -- "the C variable
//! surface, the `Fprovide`, and which `loadup.el` branch runs" -- for the
//! window system.  Ledger 190 measured the subr surface.  This file owns the
//! `Fprovide` itself, for **every** feature GNU's `src/*.c` provides, because
//! `(featurep 'X)` is what GNU's own Lisp asks to decide whether a capability
//! is there, and a `t` this build cannot back is worse than an error: the
//! caller believes it.
//!
//! GNU's `lisp/net/tramp-gvfs.el:123` is the shape:
//!
//! ```elisp
//! (defconst tramp-gvfs-enabled
//!   (ignore-errors
//!     (and (featurep 'dbusbind)
//!          (tramp-compat-funcall 'dbus-get-unique-name :session)
//!          ...)))
//! ```
//!
//! -- the same "`featurep`/`fboundp` as the build test" ledger 190 found at
//! `lisp/t-mouse.el:49`, and `lisp/net/dbus.el` repeats it at seven sites as
//! `(or (featurep 'dbusbind) (signal 'dbus-error (list "Emacs not compiled
//! with dbus support")))`.  A build that answers `t` there does not gain a
//! capability; it loses GNU's own detection AND GNU's own honest error.
//!
//! Ledger 192.
