//! GNU-style wait policy for VM event servicing.
//!
//! GNU Emacs routes process waits, input waits, timer waits, and redisplay
//! through `wait_reading_process_output` with explicit policy flags.  This
//! module gives Neomacs the same shape: callers describe what may be serviced
//! and what should complete the wait; lower-level process/input code only
//! performs the service pass.

/// hand out.
///
/// # The fact this type exists to enforce
///
/// GNU has exactly five `status_notify` call sites
/// (`grep -n 'status_notify' src/process.c`):
///
/// | GNU line | function | what it had just done |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | :1129 | `Fdelete_process`, connection arm | set the status itself |
/// | :1149 | `Fdelete_process`, child arm | set the status itself |
/// | :7181 | `process_send_signal`, SIGCONT arm | set the status itself |
/// | :5554 | `wait_reading_process_output`, top of loop | nothing -- the record is the SIGCHLD handler's |
/// | :5854 | `wait_reading_process_output`, after the select | nothing -- as above |
///
/// The three subr sites notify a status the subr wrote on the line above.
/// **Every status GNU discovered ASYNCHRONOUSLY is notified from the wait, and
/// from nowhere else.**  `process_pending_signals` -- what `maybe_quit` reaches
/// through `probably_quit` (src/lisp.h:3896-3900, src/eval.c:1868-1876) -- is
/// not on the list at all; its entire body is
///
/// ```c
///   pending_signals = false;
///   handle_async_input ();
///   do_pending_atimers ();                          src/keyboard.c:8367-8372
/// ```
///
/// and `grep -c status_notify` over it is **0**.  Nor does GNU's SIGCHLD reach
/// `pending_signals` in the first place: `grep -n 'pending_signals = '
/// src/*.c` returns eleven lines and **not one of them is in `process.c`**.
/// `handle_child_signal`'s wake is `child_signal_notify` (:7766-7767), one
/// `emacs_write` to a self-pipe that the `select` in the wait is watching.
/// GNU's own header for the handler names the destination in words:
/// *"That is saved for the next time keyboard input is done"* (:7669-7671) --
/// and the function that does keyboard input is `wait_reading_process_output`.
///
/// # Why a type rather than a comment
///
/// Ledger 193 drained the child-status record at `Context::maybe_quit`, and
/// the suites did not catch it: a green engine run and a green oracle run
/// prove nothing about *when* a sentinel runs.  What caught it is Lisp that
/// binds a variable around its wait -- `magit-run-post-commit-hook` is keyed on
/// `last-command` -- and finds the binding gone by the time the sentinel runs.
///
/// So the constructors below are private to this module.  `maybe_quit` cannot
/// build one; neither can a subr, a filter, or a future safe point.  Since
/// `ProcessManager::record_child_status_changes` and
/// `Context::record_and_notify_status_changes` both require one, "the child-status
/// record was drained at the wrong safe point" is not rejected by a check --
/// it is a sentence with no grammar.
