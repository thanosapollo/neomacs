//! GNU's post-image `init_*` sequence, transcribed.
//!
//! **The dump is written from inside `-l loadup`, so the image carries
//! mid-load state.**  `lisp/loadup.el` calls `dump-emacs-portable` while
//! loadup.el is itself still being loaded, so whatever a loader, a keyboard
//! or an allocator global happened to hold at that instant is what the image
//! carries.  GNU knows this and says so in `main` itself, at the line right
//! after the image is mapped in (src/emacs.c:1438-1442):
//!
//! ```text
//!   /* ... loading the pdumper file above assigns to those variables values
//!      from the dump stage, which might be incorrect ... */
//! ```
//!
//! GNU's answer is not to dump more carefully.  It is to run a fixed sequence
//! of `init_*` functions on EVERY startup, dumped image or not, each of which
//! re-establishes the facts its subsystem owns.  `load_pdump` is called at
//! src/emacs.c:1436; every `init_*` call below that line is part of that
//! sequence.  This port has exactly one place that runs at the same moment --
//! `finalize_cached_bootstrap_eval` (super::load) -- so it owes the same
//! sequence, and this module is that sequence written down.
//!
//! Entry 174 ported ONE of them (`init_lread`) after `load-in-progress` was
//! found wedged at `t` for the entire life of every session, and said plainly
//! that four functions read out of about thirty is a spot-check.  Entry 177
//! is the systematic screen: all 40 post-image call sites, each with its GNU
//! citation and each classified.
//!
//! ## Why this is a table and not a list of statements
//!
//! A hand-written `eval.set_variable(...)` per fact is invisible to any
//! check: nothing can tell a fact that was deliberately left alone from one
//! nobody thought of.  Ledger 173's law applies -- *a predicate over rows
//! that exist cannot see a row that was never written* -- so the guard has to
//! be able to fail on an EMPTY table.  Three things make that true here:
//!
//! 1. [`PostImageInit::ALL`] is declared with length [`PostImageInit::COUNT`],
//!    which is derived from the LAST discriminant.  Adding a variant without
//!    adding its row to `ALL` is a **compile error**, not an omission.
//! 2. [`PostImageInit::site`] is an exhaustive `match`, so a variant with no
//!    GNU citation and no classification is a **compile error** too.
//! 3. `post_image_init_test.rs` asserts the enumeration's SIZE and its
//!    emacs.c line ordering against the numbers screened from GNU's `main`.
//!    An empty table fails that test rather than passing it vacuously.
