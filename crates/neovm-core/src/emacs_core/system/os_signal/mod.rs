//! GNU's OS signal dispositions, and the one rule that decides their shape:
//! **what a signal handler is allowed to touch.**
//!
//! Before this module, `grep -rn 'sigaction|signal_hook|SIGWINCH|SIGINT'` over
//! `neovm-core`, `neomacs-bin`, `neomacs-display-runtime` and `neovm-worker`
//! returned **zero production hits** (ledger 180 §2, ledger 184).  This port
//! installed no OS signal handler at all, so every signal whose default
//! disposition is `Term` simply killed the editor.  Measured, `-Q --batch`,
//! at a process spinning in pure Lisp:
//!
//! ```text
//!              GNU 31.0.90                     this port, before
//!   SIGUSR2    rc=0, debug-on-quit t           rc=140, killed
//!   SIGUSR1    rc=0, nothing armed             rc=138, killed
//! ```
//!
//! # What GNU installs, and where
//!
//! `init_signals` (src/sysdep.c) is called from `main` after the image is in
//! memory, and its user-signal tail is:
//!
//! ```c
//!   /* SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 are used internally by the android_select
//!      function.  */
//!   #if !defined HAVE_ANDROID
//!   #ifdef SIGUSR1
//!     add_user_signal (SIGUSR1, "sigusr1");
//!   #endif
//!   #ifdef SIGUSR2
//!     add_user_signal (SIGUSR2, "sigusr2");
//!   #endif
//!   #endif
//! ```
//!
//! and `add_user_signal` (src/keyboard.c:8464-8483) ends with
//!
//! ```c
//!   emacs_sigaction_init (&action, deliver_user_signal);
//!   sigaction (sig, &action, 0);
//! ```
//!
//! # What a handler may legitimately do -- the whole design input
//!
//! GNU states the rule in the comment block above `handle_child_signal`
//! (src/process.c:7666-7688), and enforces it with a bug report inlined into
//! `child_signal_notify` (:7616-7650):
//!
//! ```text
//!    ** WARNING: this can be called during garbage collection.        /* :7673-7675 */
//!    ** Malloc WARNING: This should never call malloc either directly
//!    or indirectly; if it does, that is a bug.                        /* :7687-7688 */
//!
//!      But this calls `emacs_perror', which in turn invokes a localized
//!      version of strerror, which is not reentrant and must not be
//!      called within a signal handler:
//!        __lll_lock_wait_private () ... malloc () ... strerror_l () ...
//!      So we no longer check errors of emacs_write here.              /* :7630-7649 */
//! ```
//!
//! What survives at the bottom of GNU's handler is one
//! `emacs_write (fd, &dummy, 1)` to a self-pipe.  A fourth constraint is one
//! file over: `deliver_process_signal` (src/sysdep.c:1729-1751) exists because
//! *"POSIX says any thread can receive a signal that is associated with a
//! process"*, and forwards to the main thread with `pthread_kill`.
//!
//! # Why that makes the design, in a port with a render thread
//!
//! GNU's own `handle_user_signal` (src/keyboard.c:8487-8521) is **not**
//! restricted to the async-signal-safe list: it reads `Vdebug_on_event`,
//! calls `SSDATA (SYMBOL_NAME (...))` and writes four Lisp globals.  GNU can
//! do that only because `deliver_process_signal` has already forwarded the
//! signal to the thread that owns those globals.
//!
//! This port cannot forward.  Its Lisp state lives in a `&mut Context` owned
//! by the Lisp thread; there is no `pthread_kill`-shaped way to hand a
//! `&mut Context` to a handler, and a handler that reached the interpreter
//! from the render thread, a worker or the WPE `GMainContext` would be a data
//! race rather than a lock-order problem.  So the split is drawn one step
//! earlier than GNU draws it:
//!
//! * **the handler** does only what GNU's SIGCHLD handler does at its very
//!   bottom -- bump a lock-free counter and write one byte to a self-pipe.
//!   Both are on the POSIX.1-2024 §2.4.3 async-signal-safe list.  It is
//!   therefore correct on *any* thread, which is why this port needs no
//!   analogue of `FORWARD_SIGNAL_TO_MAIN_THREAD`.
//! * **`handle_user_signal`'s body** runs on the Lisp thread at the next safe
//!   point, [`drain_pending_os_signals`], which is where a `&mut Context`
//!   exists.
//!
//! # The type-level part: there is no place to write handler code
//!
//! The bad state this module exists to rule out is "a handler that can touch
//! a non-async-signal-safe thing".  It is made unrepresentable by leaving the
//! handler with nothing to be extended by:
//!
//! * [`HandledSignal`] is a closed, `#[repr(usize)]`, data-only enum whose
//!   `ALL` is declared with length `COUNT` derived from the last discriminant,
//!   so a variant that is not listed is a compile error (ledger 177's
//!   `post_image_init.rs` and ledger 180's `child_status.rs` shape).
//! * [`InstalledDisposition`] is **data, not code**: it carries GNU's
//!   `add_user_signal` NAME and nothing callable.  There is no per-signal
//!   handler hook, no function pointer and no closure anywhere in this
//!   module, so adding a signal adds a citation and a name -- never a line
//!   that runs in signal context.
//! * the one `extern "C"` handler is private, total over `HandledSignal`, and
//!   takes an [`AsyncSignalScope`]: a `!Send`/`!Sync` capability token with no
//!   public constructor whose only two methods are the two POSIX-listed
//!   operations.  **No method on it takes or returns a `Value`**, so a handler
//!   body that reached the interpreter would not type-check.
//!
//! The honest limit of that guarantee is worth stating: Rust lets any function
//! reach a `static`, so this is not a proof that no future author could lock a
//! mutex in signal context.  What it does buy is that the per-signal surface
//! is data and the code is written once -- the unsafe spelling is absent from
//! the type the way `child_status.rs` keeps `waitpid` out of `SweepableChild`.
//!
//! # Where the drain runs, and why that is GNU's own hot path
//!
//! GNU's safe point checks a `volatile bool` next to the quit flag:
//!
//! ```c
//!   /* src/lisp.h:3879, 3896-3900 */
//!   extern bool volatile pending_signals;
//!   INLINE void
//!   maybe_quit (void)
//!   {
//!     if (!NILP (Vquit_flag) || pending_signals)
//!       probably_quit ();
//!   }
//! ```
//!
//! so [`pending`] is one relaxed `'static` load in `Context::maybe_quit`'s
//! fast path -- exactly the shape and exactly the cost GNU pays, and the same
//! shape this port already uses for the Lisp profiler's watchdog flag.
