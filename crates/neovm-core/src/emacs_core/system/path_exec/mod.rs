//! `PATH_EXEC`: this installation's architecture-dependent private directory.
//!
//! GNU declares one directory that is neither `bindir` nor a data directory
//! and holds everything that is both private to Emacs and specific to the
//! machine it was built for -- the helper programs and the dump image:
//!
//! ```c
//! /* The extra search path for programs to invoke.  This is appended to
//!    whatever the PATH environment variable says to set the Lisp
//!    variable exec-path and the first file name in it sets the Lisp
//!    variable exec-directory.  exec-directory is used for finding
//!    executables and other architecture-dependent files.  */
//! #define PATH_EXEC "/usr/local/libexec/emacs"
//! ```
//! -- `src/epaths.in:53-58`, filled in by `make epaths-force`
//! (`Makefile.in:473`) from `archlibdir`, which configure defines as
//!
//! ```text
//! archlibdir='${libexecdir}/emacs/${version}/${configuration}'
//! ```
//! -- `configure.ac:290`.
//!
//! It has three consumers, all ported here or by this module's callers:
//!
//! * `init_callproc_1` (`src/callproc.c:1959-1963`) seeds `exec-path` from
//!   `EMACSPATH` defaulting to `PATH_EXEC`, takes `exec-directory` from its
//!   car, and appends the whole thing to `$PATH`.
//! * `init_callproc` (`src/callproc.c:1976-1991`) overrides both with
//!   `<installation-directory>/lib-src` when Emacs is running uninstalled --
//!   "Running uninstalled, so default to tem rather than PATH_EXEC".
//! * `load_pdump` (`src/emacs.c:1046-1120`) looks for the dump image in
//!   `PATH_EXEC` once the search beside the executable has failed.
//!
//! # How this port resolves it
//!
//! GNU bakes an absolute path into `epaths.h` at configure time and repairs
//! it at runtime only where the tree is relocatable: `w32_relocate` on
//! MS-Windows and `ns_relocate` (`src/nsterm.m:524-553`) inside a macOS app
//! bundle, where `epaths-force-ns-self-contained` (`Makefile.in:511-515`)
//! has already rewritten `PATH_EXEC` to the bundle-relative
//! `Contents/MacOS/libexec`.
//!
//! Neomacs has no configure step, so -- exactly as
//! [`super::load::runtime_project_root`] does for the runtime root -- it
//! probes instead of baking, walking a fixed candidate list relative to the
//! running executable and taking the first that exists.  Every shipped
//! layout is a row in [`path_exec_candidates`] and a case in the tests.
//!
//! The probe is existence-gated on purpose: a tree that ships no `libexec`
//! at all falls through to [`PathExecSource::Uninstalled`] and behaves
//! exactly as it did before this module existed, so adding the concept
//! cannot break a layout that has not adopted it yet.
