//! Undo system for buffers — GNU Emacs–compatible Lisp list approach.
//!
//! The undo list is stored as a direct Lisp `Value` in the buffer-local
//! property `buffer-undo-list`.  This module provides helper functions
//! that manipulate that `Value` list, matching GNU Emacs's undo.c:
//!
//! - `t` means undo is disabled
//! - `nil` means undo is enabled with an empty list
//! - Records are cons-ed onto the FRONT (most recent first)
//!
//! Entry types:
//! - `(BEG . END)` — insertion (1-indexed positions)
//! - `(TEXT . POS)` — deletion (TEXT is string, POS is 1-indexed,
//!   negative if point was at end of deleted region)
//! - `POS` (integer) — cursor position (1-indexed)
//! - `(t . MODTIME)` — first-change marker
//! - `nil` — undo boundary
