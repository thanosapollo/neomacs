# Concurrent GC for neovm-core — as-built architecture

A background GC thread marks concurrently with the mutator, which stops only
for two short safe-point handshakes per cycle (root snapshot at the start,
mark termination at the end). This is the Go-style design: concurrent
tri-color mark, SATB (snapshot-at-the-beginning / Yuasa) deletion barrier,
cooperative safe points, precise (non-conservative) rooting.

STATUS: the concurrent collector is the ONLY sliced/marking collector. The
old incremental slicer and the `NEOVM_GC_CONCURRENT` / `NEOVM_GC_SATB` env
gates were REMOVED in the GC-modernization path-collapse (branch
`neovm-gc-modernization`, 2026-06-19) and this doc describes the code
as-built through the 2026-07 arc (parity mark bits, size-class object arenas,
the task-01 concurrent-claim dispatcher, the adaptive pacer, dump-less
concurrent, per-group handshake stats). A stop-the-world (STW) full trace
survives ONLY as an internal phase — the first-cycle bootstrap (before the
heap is eligible for concurrent marking) and explicit `garbage-collect` — not
as a rival path. Everything else runs concurrently and terminates at a brief
STW handshake. Verify every claim below against `tagged/gc.rs` +
`tagged/header.rs` + `emacs_core/runtime/symbol/mod.rs` (the code is truth; this doc is a
map).

## The Rust-specific hard problem

A GC thread reading the object graph while the mutator writes it is a data
race = UB in Rust, not merely a logic bug. Every GC-visible word the two
threads touch is therefore accessed atomically. To bound the shared surface,
ONLY MARKING goes concurrent; allocation and sweep stay mutator-side
(**no-free-during-mark**: the free list and every deallocation are
mutator-only — the GC thread never frees, and sweep runs world-stopped at the
termination handshake). The GC thread holds NO `&mut TaggedHeap` (two `&mut`
to one heap is UB even with atomic fields); it works entirely through:

- Cons block mark bitmaps (atomic `fetch_or`), read via atomic `load_car/load_cdr`.
- `GcHeader.marked` (`AtomicU8`), claimed with an atomic `swap`.
- Read-only `Arc` snapshots of owned page bases + the dump address span.
- A shared `Mutex`-backed SATB buffer (mutator appends; GC drains into gray).

x86-64 relaxed atomic loads/stores compile to plain `mov`, so the per-slot
cost is ~zero; the cost was the pervasive representation change.

## Object model & the heap

### Parity mark bits (`tagged/header.rs`)

`GcHeader` has an atomic mark byte, generation state, an atomic remembered
byte and collector-owned list links. Its layout is unchanged by U3.5.

- `marked` is the RAW mark-parity bit (relaxed atomic). For a YOUNG
  (non-tenured, heap-owned) non-cons object, "marked this cycle" ≡
  `marked == TaggedHeap::mark_parity`. The heap FLIPS `mark_parity` at
  `begin_collection` instead of walking `all_objects` to clear bits, so the
  raw value alone is meaningless — interpret it via `is_marked_at` /
  `mark_claim_at` against the owning heap's parity. The third byte value,
  `UNMARKED_AT_REST`, is white under either parity.
- `is_marked_at(parity)` = `marked.load(Relaxed) == parity.byte()`.
- `mark_claim_at(parity)` = `marked.swap(parity.byte(), Relaxed) != parity.byte()` — the
  atomic CLAIM: sets the bit and returns `true` iff THIS call flipped it from
  unmarked → marked. Used by the concurrent GC thread to mark a heap object
  exactly once with no `&mut TaggedHeap`; the non-cons analogue of
  `atomic_mark_owned_cons_ptr`. A lost race is benign (the object ends up
  `== parity` either way).
- **born-at-parity**: heap allocation paths overwrite `marked` at the link
  seams with the current parity (allocate-black), so a mid-cycle birth is
  already marked and never enters the GC's gray.
- **generation-before-parity read order**: every reader asks
  `black_by_generation(scope)` first. A minor skips all tenured owners; a
  major skips only permanent image survivors and traces ordinary old owners.
  Generation state changes only after the worker joins.
- Mapped (pdump) objects mark via the heap's mutator-only side tables and
  never interpret `marked` at all.

`marked` is atomic so the GC thread can claim it while the mutator
allocate-blacks / reads it without a data race.

### Size-class object arenas (`tagged/gc.rs`)

Non-cons heap objects live in per-TYPE `ObjectArena<T>` allocators, one arena
per kind, each paging a homogeneous size class. `OBJECT_PAGE_BYTES = 64 KiB`;
a page holds `OBJECT_PAGE_BYTES / T::SLOT_BYTES` slots. Size classes
(`T::SLOT_BYTES`, the arena stride):

| Arena | Object | `SLOT_BYTES` | `size_of::<T>()` bound |
|-------|--------|-------------:|-----------------------:|
| `float_arena` | `FloatObj` | 32 | == 24 |
| `string_arena` | `StringObj` | 64 | ≤ 56 |
| `vector_arena` | `VectorObj` | 64 | ≤ 48 |
| `bytecode_arena` | `ByteCodeObj` | 384 | ≤ 376 |
| `lambda_arena` | `LambdaObj` | 128 | ≤ 120 |
| `macro_arena` | `MacroObj` | 128 | ≤ 120 |
| `record_arena` | `RecordObj` | 64 | ≤ 56 |
| `symbol_with_pos_arena` | `SymbolWithPosObj` | 64 | ≤ 56 |
| `marker_arena` | `MarkerObj` | 128 | ≤ 120 |
| `bignum_arena` | `BignumObj` | 64 | ≤ 56 |

The struct must fit in `SLOT_BYTES` minus an 8-byte trailing free-link word
(`FREE_LINK_OFFSET = SLOT_BYTES - size_of::<usize>()`), const-checked. Conses
use a separate block allocator (`CONS_BLOCK`) with its own mark bitmap.

**Page-ownership oracle** — `ObjectArena::owns` (registry + stride + alloc
bit) is the EXACT page-span test that classifies a discovered address at claim
time. The owned-page set enumerated for sweep and for the claim snapshots
INCLUDES RETIRED (bump-exhausted, full) pages — a retired page's slots are all
live tenured/owned objects, so it is swept and snapshotted like any other.
`ObjectArena::sweep_range` is the only reclaimer.

### When the concurrent collector runs — dump-less concurrent

```rust
should_run_concurrent = if partition_dump { dump_blackened }
                        else { bootstrap_collected }
```

- WITH a dump partition: concurrent runs once the mapped pdump image has been
  promoted + blackened (`promote_and_blacken` at the first partition cycle's
  sweep end sets `dump_blackened`). The first partition cycle itself is the STW
  full trace that does the promotion.
- WITHOUT a dump (a **dump-less heap**): concurrent runs after the bootstrap
  cycle (`bootstrap_collected`) — the first collection is an STW bootstrap,
  and every later cycle marks concurrently. (This is new vs. the historical
  "concurrent only post-blackened-dump" rule; test
  `dumpless_heap_enables_concurrent_after_bootstrap_and_collects`.)
- A heap that registers a dump AFTER dump-less cycles reverts to the dump rule
  (the first partition cycle must be the STW full trace regardless of earlier
  bootstraps).

## The two handshakes (the only STW)

1. **Start / root snapshot** (`concurrent_begin` + `launch_concurrent_mark`):
   stop the mutator briefly; flip `mark_parity` (O(1) "clear"); seed the
   collector-internal + remembered + context roots (push to gray); capture the
   read-only snapshots the GC thread will use (cons-block bases, Tier-B vector
   backings, and the float / vector / bytecode PAGE-BASE sets); arm the SATB
   barrier + allocate-black; send the job and RETURN (do not block).
2. **Termination** (`terminate_concurrent_mark`): stop the mutator; join the
   GC thread and fold residual SATB + deferred values into gray; re-seed the
   runtime / remembered / context roots + mid-cycle new symbol cells
   (`trace_new_symbol_cells`); dirty-owner re-gray (see invariant 4); final
   mutator-side `mark_all`; weak-table / finalizer / dead-marker post-passes;
   then the deferred sweep.

Both include root scans. Termination also traces the deferred residue to a
fixpoint; its cost depends on the kinds the worker can trace and the mutations
made during the cycle. Trace measurements report start, join and drain costs
separately.

**HandshakeStats** (`handshake_stats` / `handshake_stats_mut`) is a
diagnostics-only (no behavior) sibling of `SweepStats` that records both
handshakes decomposed PER PHASE and PER ROOT GROUP: the mark-clear three-way
split (cons-bitmap memset / young non-cons `all_objects` walk / mapped resets),
`seed_all_context_roots`'s per-group `RootSeedBreakdown` at both start AND
termination, the task-01 float / vector / bytecode page-base snapshot timings,
join/fold, new-symbol tracing, and once-per-handshake O() size probes. The
evaluator populates the context-root breakdown via `handshake_stats_mut`.

## The concurrent mark loop & claim dispatcher

`run_concurrent_mark` loops draining its local gray queue and the shared SATB
buffer until both are empty and the mutator asks it to stop. It marks:

- **Conses** via `atomic_mark_owned_cons_ptr`: the mark bitmap is at
  `block_base + CONS_MARKS_OFFSET`, derivable from the cons pointer alone; the
  bit is set with an atomic `fetch_or` (Relaxed), returning true iff it
  flipped. Children read with atomic `load_car` / `load_cdr`. An immutable
  `Arc<HashSet>` of owned cons-block bases (snapshotted at the STW start) says
  which conses it may mark vs. defer.
- **A small owned non-cons set** via `concurrent_try_mark_owned(val, job,
  gray)`, DEFERRING every other non-cons (and non-owned cons) to the STW
  termination. Each arm first tests a PAGE-BASE snapshot hit BEFORE any
  dereference (a hit is simultaneously the ownership proof AND the type
  classification — an arena page owns its 64 KiB span exclusively, which also
  rules out mapped objects); a MISS returns `false` = defer (fail-safe):

  - **strings** → `concurrent_try_mark_string`: owned page strings with NO
    interval tree (`intervals_ptr()` null) claim the owned `GcHeader`; zero Lisp
    children ⇒ the claim IS the trace. Interval-bearing strings defer.
    Counter: `str_claimed`.
  - **floats** → page-snapshot claim: a float has ZERO Lisp children
    (`mark_value`'s float arm is mark-only), so `mark_claim_at` IS the complete
    trace. Counter: `float_claimed`.
  - **vectors** → page-snapshot HEADER claim only. The children are NOT
    inline-traced here; they are covered by the union of {the Tier-B
    start-snapshot scan of the possibly-retired-on-write start backing} +
    {the SATB deletion barrier on every slot / bulk overwrite} +
    {allocate-black for mid-cycle values} + {the termination root reseed} +
    {the termination dirty-owner re-gray of `satb_snapshotted_owners`
    (invariant 4)}. The last leg is NOT optional (it restores the
    current-backing re-trace that header-claiming removed for mid-cycle
    register→heap insertions). Counter: `vec_claimed`.
  - **bytecode** → page-snapshot HEADER claim + GC-thread GRAY-PUSH of the
    children (arglist / constants / env / doc_form / interactive / extra_slots;
    `params` is SymIds, untraced by design). Sound ONLY because published
    bytecode is COMPILE-TIME immutable (the sole mutation seam is
    `#[cfg(test)] with_bytecode_data_mut_for_test`), so a fresh claim proves
    the object pre-dates the cycle and its fields are stable to read on the GC
    thread. The one exception is `ByteCodeObj::slot_objects`, outside `data`:
    two atomic words (the `aref` code string and constants vector), each
    written at most once from nil by `install_bytecode_slot_object` after the
    barrier, read here with Acquire, and holding either a born-black object or
    a prototype's code string reachable through the prototype. Counter:
    `bc_claimed`.
  - **subrs** → recognize-and-drop (NOT a claim): `SubrObj`s are `Box::leak`ed
    statics (`allocate_static_subr_object`), never page-allocated, never linked
    into `all_objects`, never swept — permanently live by construction. The
    header bit is DEAD STATE nobody reads. The arm just bumps `subr_dropped`
    and returns `true` ("handled, nothing owed"); it writes no header and a
    subr has no Lisp children. Gated on `type_tag == VecLikeType::Subr`.
  - **mapped (pdump) veclikes** (`dump_lo..dump_hi`) → always DEFER: they mark
    via the mutator-only side table; recognizing one as leaked or claiming its
    header would leave the side-table mark unset and panic the tricolor /
    partition verifiers (the mis-claim UAF shape).

**Claim-ordering rules (H4/H5, MANDATED):**
1. Any inspection that can still send the value to `deferred` runs BEFORE the
   claim — a claimed-THEN-deferred object whose termination trace early-returns
   on the (now-set) mark bit would DROP its children.
2. The generation check runs BEFORE the parity claim. Generation-black owners
   need no claim; ordinary old owners are white and traceable at a major.

## U3.5 claims and Tier-H hash snapshots

`NEOVM_GC_CONCURRENT_CLAIMS=1` enables these additions. The process policy is
captured in each heap and job and defaults **off**. Off captures no hash
snapshot, maintains no hash registry and allocates no additional claim counters.
Records, closures, char-tables and interval-bearing strings retain their existing
tracing discipline.

Marker, bignum and symbol-with-pos claims require a start-snapshot page hit
before any header read. Chunk-map counts exclude pages added during the mark;
base-set snapshots provide the same rule with the chunk map disabled. Markers
and bignums have no Lisp children. A freshly claimed symbol-with-pos queues its
two immutable fields, including bare symbols in both full and generational
major cycles. Failed claims never read a birth's partially initialized payload.

Symbol handoff covers transitive descendants too. The worker selects its symbol
policy once at launch, independently of generation/promotion: generational
majors and U3.5-enabled full cycles preserve symbols found in cons car/cdr and
every bytecode child field. Direct snapshot-field handoff alone is insufficient:
a claimed hash or symbol-with-pos can expose a cons containing an uninterned
symbol, and termination cannot repair it by retracing an already-claimed cons.
The worker returns deduplicated symbol IDs; the coordinator records their
side-table liveness after join in both generation modes. Default-off legacy full
loops retain their
existing policy, with no new per-edge knob branch.

Hash tables use exact owned Box addresses rather than page membership. The
start handshake finds tables in the heap's existing exact live-Box inventory,
which includes ordinary-old owners; it adds no hash registration on allocation
or free. Capture includes only hydrated,
nonweak, generation-relevant tables. Mapped and post-start owners miss the
snapshot. Weak and pending tables refuse before the claim, preserving
mutator-side weak registration and hydration. Capture does not root a table:
the worker scans only eligible owners it reaches.

Concurrent state is owned through the original `Option<Box<GenCensus>>` heap
field. A claims-only carrier disables census measurement and remembered-set
probes. A census moves only its measurement history, so the outer carrier,
snapshot, counters and registered mutators' retained buffers stay owned until
the cycle's joined termination releases them. With both facilities disabled,
the pointer is absent and existing heap and mutator member offsets are unchanged.

Capture records constant-sized metadata per table: `(slots.as_ptr(),
slots.len())` and copied custom comparison/hash callbacks. It does not walk
slots or allocate initialized-field descriptors. Before claiming the header,
the worker acquires the entry mutex and atomically elects AVAILABLE→READING.
It keeps that read lease through the complete scan, including callbacks and
child routing, even if stop arrives. Writers use the same mutex, so the
original backing remains alive and immutable during every read. The worker
matches typed `Option<HashTableEntry>` cells on demand, then reads initialized
`Some` key/value words atomically with Acquire. It never interprets the raw
Option representation or reads None payload, padding, live Vec metadata,
index, weak mode, user-hash memo or mutability byte. This avoids assumptions
about Option layout while still visiting removed-entry holes in `slots.len()`.

The reader publishes DONE with Release after routing every child, or after a
failed header claim that owes no scan. DONE and DEFERRED are terminal for that
cycle: no later reader may dereference the captured pointer. A resize, clear
or replacement may therefore free attached backing after the completed lease
has released its mutex. A dropped incomplete lease poisons the cycle.

Round 2 retains three policies for comparison. `CloneUntilTraced` clones only
on the first write before reader admission; DONE mutations need no copy.
`DeferWrites` atomically elects AVAILABLE→DEFERRED under the writer mutex before
the preimage barrier and any worker header claim. The worker then leaves that
owner for mutator tracing. If a reader wins admission first, the writer waits
for its complete lease and subsequently mutates without copying: this policy
uses zero COW. `AlwaysClone` retains the once-per-cycle copy policy for the
legacy measurement. A copying writer atomically elects UNTOUCHED→COPYING,
clones slots, transfers the unchanged original Vec to its own mutator
retirement log, then publishes READY with Release. The selected defaults are
`DeferWrites` and lazy discovery from the live-Box inventory; the master
`NEOVM_GC_CONCURRENT_CLAIMS` knob remains off pending qualification gates.
`NEOVM_GC_CONCURRENT_HASH_POLICY=traced` selects `CloneUntilTraced`, and
`=legacy` selects `AlwaysClone`. Capture always uses the existing exact
live-Box inventory; allocation and free maintain no additional hash-address
registry. These policies take effect only when the master knob is enabled.

`with_hash_table_mut` retains the shared snapshot and locks an eligible table's
entry before the preimage barrier or payload borrow. The guard covers reserve,
removal, clear, whole replacement, hydration and switch-cache epoch changes.
Its dirty atomic RMW admits one current-child retrace into the winning
mutator's log, regardless of copying or deferral. Termination merges every
mutator's logs and traces current children even if the header was claimed;
replacing a strong table with a weak table still registers the current weak
table on the mutator. This preserves existing white values inserted during
marking as well as SATB deletion coverage. No entry mutex spans a Lisp callback
or collector safe point.

The heap and job share the snapshot. Retired originals remain owned by mutator
logs after the worker joins, through the primary and black-born drains,
finalizers, weak fixpoint and verification. Termination drops snapshot handles
and retired buffers before detaching sweep lists. Heap teardown joins any active
reader before cleanup. Unwound/incomplete reader or mutation guards publish a
snapshot-wide poison flag; poisoned locks and incomplete COPYING remain
observable by `gc_locks_poisoned`. Join refuses to terminate or sweep a poisoned
cycle instead of treating it as a completed read or write.
The new shared protocol uses atomic RMW/locks and all-mutator iteration, while
ordinary same-table read/write APIs retain the runtime's existing ownership
requirements.

The generational barrier and remembered sets remain in place. GNU custom-test
guards modify only the mutability metadata and inhibit GC; guard entry does
not COW or invalidate a key cache. Actual user-hash memo writes use the guarded
mutation wrapper and its selected policy. The worker reads copied callback
values and never executes Lisp or reads guard metadata.

## The SATB (deletion / Yuasa) barrier

Before the mutator overwrites a heap slot it logs the OLD value; the GC drains
those into gray, keeping the start-of-cycle snapshot live regardless of
concurrent mutation. The log itself is a `Mutex<Vec<TaggedValue>>` (a locked
append, deduplicated per owner per cycle); what is cheap is the inline gate
in front of it (see "The barrier window" below), which sends a store to the
log only while a mark runs. New objects allocate-black.

- Every `tagged/mutate.rs` heap-slot store fires `note_heap_write` /
  `note_heap_slot_write` (owner-driven `record_heap_write`, which logs the
  pre-overwrite children via `collect_veclike_children`) BEFORE the store.
- Every symbol value / function / plist overwrite fires `note_root_overwrite`.
- The barrier's inline gate tests the barrier window, which is ALL for the
  whole life of a concurrent mark, so the SATB log fires even when owner
  write-tracking is Disabled (this was once a real correctness bug: the old
  gate short-circuited before `record_heap_write` and the log never fired).
- The GC drains a shared `Mutex<Vec<TaggedValue>>` SATB buffer into gray.

## The barrier window (`tagged/gc/barrier_window.rs`)

Every state that makes `record_heap_write` do something is folded into one
owner-address window `(lo, len)`: **ALL** during a concurrent mark or owner
tracking, **the dump span** when only the partition is active (the steady
state), **empty** otherwise. A store by owner `a` leaves the inline gate iff
`a - lo <u len`, or `a` is a non-cons whose header says tenured and not yet
remembered (`GcHeader::needs_remembering`); only then is the
`HeapWriteRecord` built (in the cold `note_heap_write_slow`, which runs the
unchanged outlined rejects and `record_heap_write`).

- **Publication.** `TaggedHeap::publish_barrier_window` is the one writer: it
  stores the window into the thread-local the Rust stores test AND into
  `JitHeapState` (`jit_state.rs`), which compiled code reads through
  `vmctx -> Context.tagged_heap -> jit`. It runs at every writer of an input
  (`set_write_tracking_mode`, `extend_dump_span`, `launch_concurrent_mark`
  after `running = true`, `join_concurrent_mark` after `running = false`);
  `set_tagged_heap` re-derives the thread-local (protocol state, no drop
  guard, like the concurrent flag).
- **The remembered bit.** `TaggedHeap::remember_owner` uses an atomic RMW to
  admit one log entry across mutators. With generations enabled, the owner
  belongs to a mutator remembered log or the coordinator's remembered seeds;
  stopped-world publication merges those logs, and cycle boundaries reset
  the bit with the corresponding set. The legacy dump partition keeps its
  persistent mapped-owner tracking. A remembered claim publishes no log by
  itself: stop-all must wait for every in-flight barrier append.
- **Plain inline stores are sound outside the window.** The window is ALL
  from the launch handshake (published before the GC thread reads anything)
  until join (cleared only after the thread exited), so an inline store never
  races a collector read; the next mark's start handshake (a channel send)
  orders it before any. JIT `setcar`/`setcdr` and `aset` of owned plain
  vectors and records store inline under exactly this test
  (`jit/compile/heap_inline.rs`).

### Generational obligations

Minors trace young objects and remembered old/image owners. Concurrent majors
trace young and ordinary old objects, skip permanent image survivors, and
promote every marked young survivor plus allocate-black births (P-all). The
worker returns promotion addresses and symbol IDs in owned logs; only the
coordinator mutates generation or symbol mark state after joining it.

The GEN invariants remain: unmarked-at-rest headers are white at either parity
(GEN-1); every old-to-young insertion reaches remembered state (GEN-2); promotion
and sweep run with mutators stopped and the reader joined (GEN-3); remembered
bits imply a pending log or published seed (GEN-4); bulk mutation closures permit
no collector safe point (GEN-5). Tier-H's dirty-owner retrace supplements these
rules rather than replacing its generational barrier.

## Allocation regions (`tagged/gc/alloc_region.rs`)

Conses and floats are handed out from bump regions: a cursor and a limit per
class in `JitHeapState`, bumped by the Rust allocator (`take_cons_cell`,
`take_float_slot`) and by JIT code alike. A refill (cold) takes one
contiguous run in GNU's source order (free list / page free-list run, else
the newest block or page's bump tail, else a fresh one).

- **I1 — black consistency.** A cons region granted while the heap allocates
  black (a deferred sweep or a concurrent mark) is pre-marked with the
  marker's relaxed atomics; a float region's slots get their full header,
  born at the current parity, at the grant. Every assignment to
  `mark_parity`, `concurrent_mark_running` or `sweep_in_progress` is preceded
  by `close_alloc_regions()`, so a region never outlives the phase it was
  granted in (debug-asserted at close via the region's recorded color).
- **I2 — collector code never sees an open region.** Every collector entry
  and walker closes first (`incremental_finish` before it resets the free
  list — a free-list run closed after that would be pushed onto the list the
  sweep rebuilds and handed out twice — the sweep slices, `sweep_cons`,
  `sweep_objects`, the page sweep, `complete_collection`,
  `begin_stw_collection`, `promote_and_blacken`, `reset_bytes_since_gc`);
  the verifiers, the block/page releases and `layout_stats` assert it.
  Closing unmarks a black region's unused tail and gives it back: a bump
  tail still ending at the limit rewinds its cursor (keeping "bits at or
  above `next_index` are never set"), anything else goes back on its free
  list in the order the sweep leaves it.
- **I3 — counter exactness.** Counters are charged per region at the grant
  and the unused tail refunded at close. `memory-use-counts`,
  `allocated_count()`, `bytes_since_gc_exact()` (`garbage-collect-maybe`,
  the profiler) subtract the open regions' unused objects; `bytes_since_gc()`
  (the pacing gates) is the charged value, never below exact, and
  `region_budget` never grants past the threshold, so a collection comes
  when it did before.
- **Publication during a mark.** Inline allocation stays on during marks and
  sweeps. A new object's fields are plain stores; it reaches the GC thread
  only through a barriered (Release) store on the slow path or through roots
  read at a stop-the-world handshake. A new black cons is never traced; a
  new float is only header-claimed, and its header was written by the Rust
  refill before any publication. Unhanded region cells are unreachable, so
  the GC thread never sets their bits.
- **The GC thread reads no allocator cursor, alloc bit or free list**, and
  pdump walks no allocator structure; allocation regions are mutator-only
  state.

## The adaptive pacer

After each sweep the heap recomputes `live_bytes` EXACTLY (cons + object +
arena-page + mapped live bytes) and resets `bytes_since_gc`. `should_collect()`
is simply `bytes_since_gc >= gc_threshold`. The evaluator's
`effective_gc_threshold_bytes` sets the threshold to the MAX of three terms,
clamped to `[1, GC_HI_THRESHOLD_BYTES]`:

1. `gc-cons-threshold` (elisp), floored at `GC_THRESHOLD_FLOOR_BYTES` — the
   GNU floor.
2. the `gc-cons-percentage` term: `(live_bytes + bytes_since_gc/2) *
   percentage`, clamped to `GC_HI` — the GNU proportional model.
3. an internal live-proportional growth term: `live_bytes *
   GC_LIVE_GROWTH_NUM/GC_LIVE_GROWTH_DEN`, clamped to `GC_HI`, so the O(live)
   full-mark cost amortizes as the heap grows.

The elisp-derived value (1–2) is a FLOOR term 3 never lowers (user settings
and defaults keep their meaning as minimum budgets); an explicit
`set_gc_threshold` override bypasses all of this (only the pacer value flows
through `set_gc_threshold_from_runtime`).

## Insertion coverage & the precise-rooting precondition (task 01 / #17)

Task 01 made the GC thread CLAIM (mark, without inline-tracing) the headers of
owned floats / vectors / bytecode. A claimed veclike's header bit is set, so
the STW termination's `mark_value` early-returns on it and never re-runs
`trace_veclike`. Before claiming, that termination re-trace of every *deferred*
veclike's CURRENT backing silently covered mid-cycle INSERTIONS (a value stored
into an owner AFTER it was scanned). Claiming removed that backstop, so the
collector now leans on these invariants (verified sound by a two-lens
adversarial review — a soundness proof + a failed reproduction):

1. **Precise-rooting precondition.** The collector is precise; there is NO
   conservative stack scan (`set_stack_bottom` is a literal no-op). Every heap
   value the mutator will use after a safepoint MUST be reachable from a seeded
   root (`trace_roots` — operand stacks / `bc_buf` / `vm_root_frames` /
   specpdl / scratch `GcRoot`s — or a thread-local root table) at every
   world-stopped mark-start. Allocation never triggers a GC, so a value need
   only be rooted before the next *safepoint*, not the next allocation. A live
   value held ONLY in an un-seeded Rust local across a mark-start is a
   root-discipline violation the STW collector mishandles at the same safe
   point too — NOT a concurrent-GC regression.

2. **SATB snapshot completeness.** Every value reachable from roots at the
   start snapshot is marked by end-of-mark. This rests on: the atomic
   world-stopped seed; a deletion barrier on EVERY `mutate.rs` heap-slot
   overwrite (all fire `note_heap_write` BEFORE the store) and EVERY symbol
   value/function/plist overwrite (`note_root_overwrite`); allocate-black for
   mid-cycle births; and the BLV-pool full re-scan at both handshakes. Symbol
   cells are the ONE root skipped at the concurrent-mark TERMINATION re-seed
   (via `ObarraySymbolCellSkipGuard`, which sets `SEED_SKIP_OBARRAY_SYMBOL_CELLS`
   so `Obarray::trace_roots` omits the per-symbol val/function/plist walk),
   because the GC thread scanned the whole obarray concurrently at the start
   (`ObarrayScanSnapshot::scan`) and `note_root_overwrite` covered every
   mid-window overwrite. The guard MUST NOT wrap the start seed or the STW
   full-collection seeds.

3. **Cons interior invariant.** A value stored into a cons (fresh OR
   pre-existing) is protected by its OWN provenance — snapshot-marked,
   born-black, deletion-logged on unlink, or obarray-covered — NEVER by tracing
   the cons. Conses are DELIBERATELY excluded from the dirty-owner re-gray:
   `push_value_children_to_satb_shared` (the callee `record_heap_write`
   invokes) gates the owner dedup on `!owner.is_cons()`, so conses never enter
   `satb_snapshotted_owners` and instead enumerate their two children directly
   each write; and `mark_cons` returns `false` on an already-set bit, so a
   fresh or already-marked cons is never re-traced. Correctness therefore
   requires the inserted value to be provenance-covered, i.e. precise rooting
   (invariant 1). Regression guard:
   `concurrent_fresh_cons_interior_of_snapshot_value_survives`.

4. **Fix-(2) scope (`join_concurrent_mark` dirty-owner re-gray).** At join, the
   CURRENT children of every multi-child owner mutated this cycle
   (`satb_snapshotted_owners`, drained via `push_value_children_to_gray`) are
   re-grayed. This restores, for concurrently-CLAIMED veclike/string owners,
   the current-backing re-trace that header-claiming removed. It is
   defense-in-depth for the relaxed-snapshot exposure of claiming — NOT a
   correctness requirement for correctly-rooted programs — and it deliberately
   does NOT extend to conses (invariant 3; conses never enter the set). It also
   MASKS precise-rooting bugs for veclike/string owners (an un-seeded inserted
   value survives) where conses would surface them as a rare UAF; extending the
   re-gray to conses is a possible future symmetric hardening.

## Load-bearing invariants / risks (future critics grep these)

- **`collect_veclike_children` MUST stay a SUPERSET of `trace_veclike`** for
  every `VecLikeType` — the remembered/SATB strong-trace path AND
  `verify_dump_partition` both rely on it. A field traced by `trace_veclike`
  but omitted from `collect_veclike_children` is invisible to the verifier
  (it uses `collect`) yet unmarked via the remembered path → a silent UAF the
  gate cannot catch. When adding a veclike field, update BOTH.
- **no-free-during-mark**: allocation and the free list stay mutator-only; the
  GC thread never frees, and sweep runs world-stopped at termination.
- **tenured-before-parity read order**: every `marked` reader short-circuits on
  `tenured` first.
- **born-at-parity**: allocation link seams write `marked` at the current
  parity (allocate-black); float slots get theirs when their allocation
  region is granted, and every region closes before the parity flips.
- **regions closed at every collector entry** (`alloc_region.rs`, I1/I2
  above): a new phase-flag writer or collector walker MUST call
  `close_alloc_regions()` first.
- **barrier window republished at every input writer** (`barrier_window.rs`):
  a new state that makes `record_heap_write` act MUST be folded into
  `barrier_window()` and republished where it changes.
- **page ownership including retired pages**: the `ObjectArena::owns` oracle
  and the claim/sweep page-sets include retired (full) pages.
- Any NEW root source must be seeded at BOTH the start and termination
  handshakes (the lesson from the historical incremental-termination UAF).
- Weak hash tables must be resolved on EVERY termination path
  (`mark_and_sweep_weak_tables`); the remembered/SATB path
  (`push_value_children_to_gray`) must STRONG-trace veclike children
  (`collect_veclike_children`, not the weak-deferring `trace_veclike`) so a
  dumped/tenured weak table conservatively retains its entries. (Reproduces
  only under `gc_stress` + `NEOVM_GC_VERIFY_PARTITION` TOGETHER.)
- UB from a missed atomic / wrong `Ordering` is worse than a UAF — gate every
  change with `gc_stress` + `NEOVM_GC_VERIFY_PARTITION` + the full suite, and
  the concurrent-mark tests under ThreadSanitizer (`run-gc-tsan.sh`).

## Closed gaps & known races (grep-able)

**CLOSED GAP (2026-07):** `module_make_interactive` (`dynamic_module.rs`) used
to write a fresh cons into a live, GC-traced `ModuleFunctionObj.interactive_form`
slot with no deletion barrier. FIXED: it now fires
`note_heap_write(func_val, HeapWriteKind::ModuleFunction)` before the store, so
`record_heap_write` logs the pre-overwrite `interactive_form` via
`collect_veclike_children`. Regression test
`concurrent_module_function_interactive_form_overwrite_keeps_child_alive`.

**FIXED RACE (task #23, 2026-07):** the concurrent obarray scan
(`ObarrayScanSnapshot::scan`) used to read a symbol slot's presence
(`if let Some(sym)` over `[Option<LispSymbol>; 4096]`) non-atomically while the
mutator wrote `LispSymbol.function_unbound` — Rust had niched the `Option` tag
INTO that `bool` byte, so the presence read raced the write. FIXED by removing
the niche: `LispSymbol.name` is now an `AtomicU32`; the chunk store is
`[LispSymbol; 4096]` (`OBARRAY_CHUNK = 4096`) with
`name == SYMBOL_NAME_SENTINEL (NameId(u32::MAX))` marking an empty slot; a fill
writes the arm fields then publishes with a terminal `name.store(id, Release)`;
the scan gates on `name.load(Acquire) != SENTINEL` before the seqlock arm reads.
`name` is write-once, so presence is monotonic (None→Some only) and the slot
stays 32 B (`assert!(size_of::<LispSymbol>() == 32)`), no pause-floor-scan
regression; single-mutator reads stay `Relaxed`. Regression test
`gc_concurrent_obarray_scan_vs_defalias_churn` (a TSan gate — the race was
benign on x86, so a functional pass does not prove the fix). TSan: 9 races → 0.

**HEADER-PUBLICATION ORDERING — FIXED (task #24 option A, 2026-07-10):** the
concurrent-claim dispatcher (`concurrent_try_mark_owned`) reads an arena
object's `GcHeader.tenured` byte (a plain `bool`) after reaching it through a
heap pointer; the mutator's arena `ptr::write` (a non-atomic whole-header
memcpy in `alloc_bytecode` / `alloc_float` / `alloc_vector`) writes that
header just before publishing the pointer. This chain used to be all
`Ordering::Relaxed` — benign on x86-64 (TSO retires the memcpy before the
publication store; a single byte cannot tear; a reused slot's prior occupant
was non-tenured, so a stale read was still `false`), but REAL UB on weak
memory (ARM / Apple Silicon), where a StoreStore reorder could expose a
torn/premature header. Fixed with option A, RELEASE/ACQUIRE ON THE
PUBLICATION CHAIN (`header.rs`): every mutator store that can make a heap
pointer GC-visible mid-mark — `ConsCell::set_car`/`set_cdr`,
`LispValueVec::store_atomic`, `store_value_atomic` (symbol value/function/
plist cells and object fields route through these) — is now `Release`, and
every GC-thread first-acquisition load — `ConsCell::load_car`/`load_cdr`,
`LispValueVec::load_atomic`/`iter_atomic`, `load_value_atomic` (the obarray +
Tier-B vector scans and the gray drain read through these) — is `Acquire`.
The pairing makes the constructor's header write happen-before any dispatcher
dereference, closing the whole class (tenured/kind/type_tag reads AND the
born-black parity-bit visibility for mid-cycle objects in reused snapshot
slots). FREE on x86 (both orderings are plain `mov` under TSO; `stlr`/`ldar`
on AArch64). Objects reached through pre-cycle channels (start-handshake
snapshots, the gray-queue channel handoff, the SATB/deferred mutexes) already
carried happens-before from those seams; the mark bits (`GcHeader.marked`,
cons block bitmaps) intentionally stay `Relaxed` — they never publish field
data, and a claim's field reads are ordered by the pointer chain, not by the
bit. The canonical contract comment lives on `load_value_atomic`
(`header.rs`). This removes the one known-benign residual TSan race
(`gc_concurrent_leaked_subr_drop_under_pdump_verifiers`); `run-gc-tsan.sh`
gates the surface (verified CLEAN, 100/100 tests, 0 reports, 2026-07-10).

**MARK-START PACING — INSTRUMENTATION ONLY (2026-07-10):** the reactive
`must_finish` cap (`bytes_since_gc > gc_threshold*4`, evaluator-side) can in
principle degrade a concurrent mark to a synchronous STW residual drain when
allocation outruns marking. Every terminated mark now measures its window
(`launch_concurrent_mark` stamps wall + `bytes_since_gc`;
`incremental_finish` closes it): alpha-1/2 EWMAs of allocation rate and mark
wall duration, `pace_lead_bytes` = rate x duration = the projected
next-window allocation, escalated (x2, EWMA-bypassing) on cap-forced
terminations; `NEOVM_GC_TRACE=1` emits `pace[bytes/thr/lead]` on every
concurrent start, a per-cycle `mark_window` line, and `must_finish#` events
(plus a lifetime `must_finish_count()` counter). A paced start trigger
(`clamp(cap - lead, threshold/4, threshold)` on the adaptive path) was built
on this and REVERTED after two-regime measurement: debug replay storms
peaked at lead ≈ 2% of threshold (0 must_finish across isolated + contended
runs), and the release-profile probe stayed dormant too (313 concurrent
starts, 0 activations, max lead/threshold 10.2% vs the 300% activation bar
— release marking outruns release allocation 40-50x, structural ceiling
~4-10%). GO-CRITERION for reintroducing the trigger (a two-line swap of
`should_collect` in `gc_safe_point_exact_should_collect` plus the clamp
helper; see ladder task-3/5 reports): any real workload whose traced
`mark_window` lead approaches `3x threshold`, or any nonzero
`must_finish_count` in the field.
