//! The write barrier's owner window: the one address range whose owners must
//! leave the inline barrier for its out-of-line part.
//!
//! Every state that makes `record_heap_write` do something is folded into a
//! single `(lo, len)` range over owner addresses:
//!
//! - **ALL** while a concurrent mark runs (the SATB log) or owner tracking is
//!   on (the dirty-owner tables): every heap write is recorded. Also ALL for
//!   the whole life of a heap under the census's remembered-set probe
//!   (`census.rs`), which must see every store.
//! - **The dump span** when only the dump partition is active (the steady
//!   state of a session with a loaded pdump): a write by a mapped owner may
//!   add it to the remembered set.
//! - **EMPTY** otherwise.
//!
//! An owner at address `a` needs the out-of-line barrier iff
//! `a.wrapping_sub(lo) < len`, or it is a non-cons owner that is tenured and
//! not yet remembered (see `barrier_gate`). With generations disabled,
//! a cons outside the window is stored inline. Rust cons stores use a
//! separate protocol mirror, equal to this window with generations disabled
//! and ALL otherwise; the outlined filter then checks generation eligibility.
//! Compiled stores keep the real window and test the cons bitmap inline.
//!
//! The window is PROTOCOL STATE, like `TAGGED_HEAP_CONCURRENT_ACTIVE`: it is
//! recomputed and republished by [`TaggedHeap::publish_barrier_window`] at
//! every writer of one of its inputs (`set_write_tracking_mode`,
//! `extend_dump_span`, `launch_concurrent_mark`, `join_concurrent_mark`), and
//! re-derived whenever a heap is (re)installed on a thread
//! (`set_tagged_heap`). There is no drop guard, for the reason the
//! concurrent flag has none: its true-window spans many mutator frames.
