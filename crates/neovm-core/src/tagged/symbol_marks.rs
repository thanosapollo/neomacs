//! Per-symbol mark bits for one collection cycle.
//!
//! GNU marks a symbol by setting the mark bit in its `struct Lisp_Symbol` and
//! moves on; whether the symbol is interned is a sweep-time question.  The
//! marker used to ask `is_canonical_id` for every symbol reference it met so
//! that only uninterned symbols entered a hash set — an epoch-checked
//! thread-local lookup per visit, which cost more than the marking itself
//! (24 M calls in a 20-keystroke rust-lsp run).  A bit per symbol id makes
//! the mark a shift and an or, and keeps the same answer for the consumers
//! that care (weak hash tables, the dump-partition verifier): a canonical
//! symbol is always live, any other symbol is live when its bit is set.
