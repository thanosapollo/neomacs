//! Mark-sweep garbage collector for the tagged pointer value system.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - **Cons cells**: GNU-shaped aligned block allocator.
//!   Each `ConsBlock` stores a fixed-size array of `ConsCell` at the front of
//!   a 64KB-aligned block, followed by packed mark bits. This lets the GC
//!   derive a cons's owning block/index directly from the pointer, matching the
//!   structure GNU Emacs uses in `alloc.c`.
//!
//! - **Floats, strings, vectors**: SIZE-CLASS OBJECT ARENA PAGES (the
//!   non-cons allocator modernization, stage 3) — 64KB-aligned pages of
//!   fixed-stride slots (Float 32B, String 64B, Vector 64B) with a per-page
//!   allocation bitmap and free list. Page objects keep their `GcHeader`;
//!   ownership is the PAGE-SPAN ORACLE (per-class page-base registry +
//!   stride + alloc bit), NOT the addr-set, and they never join the
//!   intrusive lists; dedicated page sweeps reclaim them.
//!
//! - **All other heap objects** (non-Vector vectorlikes): allocated
//!   via the system allocator, linked via intrusive `GcHeader.next` list
//!   for sweeping, with an address index for O(1) ownership checks during
//!   marking.
//!
//! - **Mark phase**: walk from roots, decode tags, follow heap pointers.
//! - **Sweep phase**: walk cons blocks (bitmap), object arena pages
//!   (bitmap), and the intrusive list (GcHeader chain), freeing unmarked
//!   objects.
//!
//! No ObjId. No generations. No stale references.
