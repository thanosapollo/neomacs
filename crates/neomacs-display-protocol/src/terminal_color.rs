//! The colour a REALIZED face carries on a terminal frame.
//!
//! GNU's realized face stores one number per colour slot -- `face->foreground`,
//! `face->background`, `face->underline_color`, all `unsigned long`
//! (src/dispextern.h:1919-1936) -- and `realize_tty_face` fills it through
//! `map_tty_color` (src/xfaces.c:6620-6694), which takes the INDEX part of
//! `tty-color-desc`'s `(NAME INDEX R G B)` and throws the RGB away.  The writer
//! then hands exactly that number to terminfo `setaf`/`setab`
//! (`turn_on_face`, src/term.c:2093-2117) and never looks at a colour again.
//!
//! So a terminal colour is not an RGB triple that someone quantizes later; it is
//! the number Lisp already computed.  That matters because the palette
//! `tty-color-desc` searched is Lisp DATA: `tty-color-alist` is registered per
//! terminal by `lisp/term/<TERM>.el` and can be changed at any time by
//! `tty-color-define` (lisp/term/tty-colors.el:839-861).  Nothing outside Lisp
//! can re-derive that number.

/// The number GNU's realized face carries for a terminal frame.
///
/// GNU packs both readings into the one `unsigned long` and disambiguates them
/// at the writer with `tty->TF_rgb_separate`; naming them as variants here makes
/// the two spellings unconfusable -- an [`Indexed`](Self::Indexed) colour cannot
/// be emitted as `38;2;R;G;B`, and a [`Direct`](Self::Direct) colour cannot be
/// emitted as `38;5;N`.
///
/// There is deliberately NO constructor from an RGB triple.  The only way to
/// obtain a value is [`TerminalColor::from_tty_color_desc`], i.e. from the
/// number `tty-color-desc` returned, so no layer downstream of face realization
/// can invent an index by quantizing on its own.
