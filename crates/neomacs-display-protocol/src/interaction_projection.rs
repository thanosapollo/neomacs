//! Where a surface point lands in the presentation the compositor is drawing.
//!
//! While panes are settled these are the same place, and every hit test can
//! take the pointer's frame-local coordinates at face value. During a layout
//! morph they are not: a pane on its way from one rect to another shows its
//! destination content at an offset, so the pixel under the pointer belongs to
//! a different position in the destination presentation than the raw
//! coordinates say. Hit testing with the raw point during a `split-window`
//! would select the wrong window, or the right window at the wrong buffer
//! position, for as long as the motion lasts.
//!
//! This module makes that impossible to get wrong by construction. A
//! [`PresentedHitQuery`](crate::presented_pointer::PresentedHitQuery) can only
//! be built from a [`PresentationFramePoint`], and a `PresentationFramePoint`
//! can only be built by mapping a surface point through a witness — a
//! [`PresentMapping`](crate::present_mapping::PresentMapping) or an
//! [`InteractionProjection`]. There is no constructor that takes two `f32`s,
//! so no call site can quietly skip the transform.
//!
//! # Why translation and a clip, not a scale
//!
//! A moving pane is not a scaled pane. Its glyphs keep their size throughout —
//! scaling text mid-motion would resample it and read as a zoom, which is not
//! what splitting a window does. What actually changes is where the pane's
//! content is drawn and how much of it is visible: the content translates and
//! the clip rectangle animates. So a [`PaneProjection`] is a translation plus a
//! clip, which is both the honest description and the reason the inverse is
//! exact rather than approximate.
