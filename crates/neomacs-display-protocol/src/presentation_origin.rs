//! What caused a presentation, and how far the buffer behind it has moved.
//!
//! The compositor has to answer two questions about a sealed presentation that
//! its geometry alone cannot settle:
//!
//! - *Did the text under this viewport change?* Scroll displacement is only
//!   exact when source and destination show the same text, and comparing
//!   character positions cannot tell an edit from a scroll. [`BufferModiff`]
//!   is the tick that can.
//! - *Was this presentation caused by an interaction that is still going on?*
//!   A window being dragged by its divider commits a new presentation on every
//!   pointer movement, and animating between them would fight the drag.
//!   [`PresentationOrigin`] says which commits belong to that drag.
//!
//! Both are facts recorded at seal time by the producer that knows them. The
//! compositor reads them; it never infers them from pixels.

/// rather than merely ambiguous. The buffer's size is not a substitute for the
