//! How a window layout change animates: four independently configurable slots
//! plus one global, in niri's vocabulary.
//!
//! A morph classifies every pane as entering, leaving, or persisting, and each
//! of those asks a different question. A pane appearing has no previous rect to
//! travel from; a pane leaving has no destination; a pane that persists has
//! both, and whether its *size* changed decides whether its text rewrapped.
//! One curve cannot answer all three well, which is why niri splits them and
//! why this does too.
//!
//! # Why six scalars per slot rather than a `MotionSpec`
//!
//! The effect registry reflects [`crate::visual_config::VisualConfig`] through
//! serde and can carry only scalar property values. Every `MotionSpec` variant
//! but `Instant` serializes to an *object*, so storing one here would make
//! `neomacs-effect-get` fail for the slot -- and `neomacs-effects-apply`, which
//! walks every effect, with it. [`WindowAnimation::motion`] converts to the
//! form the compositor samples.
//!
//! Every field is present whichever `kind` is selected, which is the registry's
//! requirement rather than a modelling choice: a property key is validated
//! against the value already stored, so a shape carrying only the active
//! variant's fields would make switching kind from Lisp unreachable --
//! `(setq neomacs-window-resize-kind 'spring)` would
//! fail with "has no property `stiffness`".
//!
//! # Why `kind` rather than overloading `easing`
//!
//! [`TransitionEasing::Spring`] already exists and is a *different thing*: a
//! fixed-shape curve over normalized tween time. Letting `:easing spring` mean
//! "a real second-order spring parameterised by damping-ratio and stiffness"
//! here, while it keeps its old meaning on `scroll-transition`, is a trap this
//! file would have to document forever.
