//! Document-time mapping for animated media sources.
//!
//! A multi-frame source lives on its own timeline: GIF frame delays, an SVG
//! document clock, a video presentation timestamp. The compositor lives on
//! presentation time. [`MediaClock`] is the only place those two domains
//! meet, so every animated source answers scheduling questions in document
//! time and every scheduling decision is made in presentation time.
//!
//! The mapping is deliberately minimal: one epoch (first presentation), one
//! pause domain (nothing is presenting the source), unit rate. Resampling
//! and per-window offsets are compositor policies that compose on top of a
//! clock rather than being baked into it, because two windows presenting the
//! same source must share one document timeline or their samples would
//! disagree.
