//! Injected time for the display engine.
//!
//! Temporal code receives time; it never obtains it. Two types express that:
//!
//! - [`EventTime`] — a moment already observed to have happened. This is the
//!   only *stored* point type: every timestamp held in long-lived state is one
//!   of these, and every one of them was minted by an adapter that watched
//!   something occur.
//! - [`FrameSample`] — the moment one frame's visuals are dated to. A
//!   parameter, never a field. Holding one means "I am sampling for a frame
//!   being produced right now"; storing one would mean sampling a later frame
//!   against a stale identity.
//!
//! The render thread has a third domain, `FutureDeadline`, for a moment the
//! loop may block until. It stays private to the scheduler because nothing
//! outside it may arm a wakeup.
//!
//! # Why these live in the protocol crate
//!
//! `neomacs-renderer-wgpu` is a *dependency* of `neomacs-display-runtime`, so
//! it can never name a type private to the runtime. Both crates depend on this
//! one, so a time type shared between the frame loop and the renderer's effects
//! has to live here.
//!
//! # Reading the clock
//!
//! [`observe_platform_now`] is the only sanctioned way to read the wall clock,
//! and it exists so that reads are *greppable*. `Instant::now()` scattered
//! through effect code is invisible; a call to `observe_platform_now` announces
//! that a platform adapter is minting an observation. There is deliberately no
//! `EventTime::now()` and no `EventTime::elapsed()` — `elapsed()` is exactly
//! the hidden clock read this module exists to remove.
