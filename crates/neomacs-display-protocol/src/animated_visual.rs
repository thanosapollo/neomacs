//! The contract animated media declares to the frame scheduler.
//!
//! The scheduler asks exactly three questions of anything that moves:
//! when does it next change on its own, does it interpolate between those
//! moments, and does it loop. A pre-authored frame list (GIF, APNG) answers
//! from its delay table; a computed timeline (animated SVG) answers from its
//! compiled plan; a native video decoder answers from its presentation
//! timestamps. The answers drive cadence demands, so a source that can say
//! "discrete steps every 100ms" never forces the compositor to 60Hz
//! sampling, and a source that interpolates smoothly never steps.
//!
//! This module owns no clocks and no pixels: document time goes in, scheduling
//! facts come out. [`crate::media_clock`] is the type that produced the
//! document time in the first place.
