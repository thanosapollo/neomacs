//! The editor's bootstrap runtime image, provisioned by the suites that need it.
//!
//! `tests/daemon_lifecycle.rs` runs the real `neomacs` daemon, and the daemon
//! boots from the runtime image beside its own binary
//! (`RuntimeImageRole::Bootstrap`, resolved by the editor's own loader).  No
//! `cargo build` produces that image: it is dumped by a byte copy of the
//! editor under its temacs role name, bootstrapping `loadup` from Lisp
//! sources.  That makes the image exactly the kind of thing this crate owns —
//! environment a test *mounts*, not assertion logic — and provisioning it
//! here is what lets `cargo nextest run` be sufficient on a fresh checkout,
//! instead of a bespoke build-and-test command whose absence surfaced as
//! "daemon never became ready" sixty seconds later.
//!
//! Provisioning is materialize-once, like the package caches: every test
//! process shares the same image, guarded by the same advisory-lock idiom,
//! and the image is regenerated only when it is missing or **older than the
//! editor binary that will load it**.  The staleness rule is the point of the
//! module.  The loader's dump fingerprint is a constant slot in dev builds,
//! so a stale image is not rejected — it is loaded silently, and the suite
//! would assert this week's behavior against last week's code.
//!
//! Names stay with the caller.  `daemon_lifecycle.rs` resolves them from the
//! editor's own loader API (`RuntimeImageRole::image_file_name`,
//! `TEMACS_ROLE_BINARY_NAME`,
//! `fingerprinted_runtime_image_path_for_executable`), so this module never
//! restates a layout that the code under test already defines.
//!
//! # Both names, deliberately
//!
//! GNU skips the fingerprinted twin of a bootstrap dump — `lisp/loadup.el`
//! guards the `add-name-to-file` with `;; Don't bother adding another name if
//! we're just building bootstrap-emacs` (GNU :640-645, and only `pdump` links
//! a `.pdmp` twin at :662).  This port does **not** skip it: neomacs
//! `lisp/loadup.el:627-638` links `bootstrap-neomacs-<fingerprint>.pdump` for
//! `pbootstrap` too, because one binary plays all three roles — the daemon
//! runs as `neomacs` (final mode), falls back to the bootstrap role, and
//! finds the image only at the loader's second rung, the fingerprinted twin.
//! Provisioning therefore requires *both* names, and the [GNU :640-645]
//! divergence is load-bearing: aligning `loadup.el` with GNU here would
//! silently break every daemon-lifecycle test by making the daemon
//! source-bootstrap instead (measured: ~4 minutes, then failure).
