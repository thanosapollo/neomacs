//! Shared test environment infrastructure for the neomacs test suites.
//!
//! The crate owns everything a test *mounts* that is not the code under
//! test:
//!
//! * [`config_env`] — GNU-bootstrapped, sealed, read-only editor
//!   configuration fixtures (Doom today, Spacemacs next) that suites
//!   mount per session;
//! * [`display`] — the deterministic, isolated display sessions
//!   (loopback-TCP Xvfb, weston-headless, sway) those suites run their
//!   scenarios on;
//! * [`runtime_image`] — the editor's bootstrap runtime image, provisioned
//!   on demand beside the editor binary and shared by every test process
//!   that boots a real daemon;
//! * [`workspace_root`] — the runtime-resolved workspace identity that
//!   archive-shipped binaries must use.
//!
//! The one test for whether something belongs here: is it environment a
//! test mounts, or assertion logic?  Assertion logic stays in the suite.
