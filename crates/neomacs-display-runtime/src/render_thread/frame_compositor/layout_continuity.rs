//! Whether an install may derive layout motion from the presentation it replaces.
//!
//! Every other fact the compositor measures is derived by diffing two
//! presentations. This one cannot be: two presentations a divider drag
//! produced look exactly like two an ordinary `split-window` produced, and the
//! difference — that a hand is on the divider right now — is not in the
//! pixels. The producer records it, and this is where it is spent.
