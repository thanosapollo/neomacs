//! Sampling a [`MotionSpec`] at a point in time.
//!
//! A `MotionSpec` describes how a value travels; it carries no position, no
//! velocity and no clock. `Motion` binds one to an origin and an interval, and
//! answers where the value is at a given frame.
//!
//! # Why this is a sample and not a step
//!
//! The obvious implementation integrates: keep the current value, advance it by
//! `dt` each frame. That makes the animation a function of *how many frames were
//! drawn*, which is not a property anyone wants. A dropped frame, a slow render,
//! a monitor at a different refresh rate, or a debugger breakpoint all change
//! where the motion ends up. Worse, the value becomes state the compositor has
//! to keep coherent across coalescing, interruption and retargeting.
//!
//! Sampling has none of that: the same `Motion` sampled at the same instant
//! always gives the same answer, so two frames drawn at the same timestamp are
//! identical, and a frame that was never drawn costs nothing. It also makes the
//! finish condition a fact about time rather than an accumulated epsilon.
