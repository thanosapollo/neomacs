//! Which panes moved between two presentations, and where they are mid-motion.
//!
//! Splitting a window, deleting one, or changing a frame's size rearranges
//! every pane at once. Installed as a single presentation, that arrives as a
//! jump: the pane the user was reading is suddenly half as wide, somewhere
//! else. What the compositor can do about it is visible in the two
//! presentations — the same window appears in both with a different rect — so
//! nothing needs to be declared for it to animate.
//!
//! # A morph is a whole-frame fact, not a per-pane one
//!
//! Panes tile: they share edges, and the edges have to stay shared throughout.
//! Animating each pane against its own clock would let two sides of a split
//! disagree about where their boundary is, and a one-pixel gap or overlap on a
//! moving seam is far more visible than the motion itself. So one [`Motion`] is
//! sampled once per frame and every pane is placed from that single sample.
//!
//! # Identity is the live window id
//!
//! Panes are matched by [`LiveDisplayWindowId`], which is the only identity that
//! survives a layout change: rects change by definition, buffers move between
//! windows, and ordering in `window_infos` is a producer detail. A window
//! present in both presentations *persisted* and can be moved; one only in the
//! destination *entered* and has no previous rect to come from; one only in the
//! source *exited* and has nothing left to draw from a retained scene.
//!
//! # What travels, and what does not
//!
//! Panes travel. The frame's overlays — the tool bar, scroll indicators, and
//! any child frame — stay where the destination presentation puts them, and
//! that is deliberate rather than an omission. A child frame's position is
//! computed by the evaluator against the layout it is being shown for, so
//! carrying it along a pane's path would move it away from the coordinates it
//! was placed at; the tool bar belongs to the frame and not to any pane at
//! all. The cursor is the exception that needs no special case: it is drawn as
//! part of a window's content, so it is already inside the picture each pane
//! samples and travels with its own pane for free.
