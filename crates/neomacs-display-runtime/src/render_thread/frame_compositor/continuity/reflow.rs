//! How far an edit pushed the rows beneath it.
//!
//! An edit does not move a viewport; it moves the rows *below itself*. Text
//! inserted above pushes everything after it down by the height of what was
//! added, a deletion pulls it up, and everything above the edit stays exactly
//! where it was. That vertical push is a different fact from a scroll, and the
//! two cannot be measured the same way.
//!
//! The producer used to declare this rather than measure it. Its
//! `LineAnimation` hint carried an `edit_y` taken from the cursor (plus one line
//! height) and an `offset` that was a constant `±char_height` whose sign came
//! from whether `buffer_size` grew. Neither number was observed: the cursor is
//! not where rows moved, an edit that wraps or unwraps a line moves them by more
//! than one line height, and an image or a variable-height row moves them by
//! something else again. This module measures both from the rows themselves.
//!
//! # Content identity, not character positions
//!
//! [`super::scroll`] matches rows by their character range, which it may do
//! precisely because the text is unchanged: the same range is the same text.
//! An edit destroys that. Inserting one character renumbers every position
//! after it, so the row that moved down is the *same row* under a different
//! range — matching by range would find nothing, or worse, match it to whatever
//! row inherited its old numbers. So rows are matched here by
//! [`GlyphRow::hash`], the fingerprint of what the row renders. Two rows with
//! the same fingerprint show the same thing, whatever the edit did to the
//! positions around them.
//!
//! # The modification tick is inverted relative to scroll
//!
//! Scroll displacement is a fact only while the tick is *unchanged*, because
//! that is what makes a character range trustworthy. A reflow is the opposite:
//! it requires the tick to have *changed*. An unchanged tick means no edit
//! happened, and rows that moved without an edit moved because the viewport
//! did — that is a scroll, and this module must not claim it as its own.
//! The buffer identity must match either way; rows of different buffers
//! correspond to nothing.
