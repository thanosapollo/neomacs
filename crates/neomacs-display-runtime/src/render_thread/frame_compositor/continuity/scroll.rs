//! How far a viewport moved between two presentations.
//!
//! Scroll *direction* is always derivable: `window_start` moving forward or
//! backward says which way the viewport went. The pixel *distance* is a harder
//! question, because it is only a fact when the two presentations show the same
//! text — and the character positions alone cannot establish that.
//!
//! The previous implementation estimated it from a character count:
//!
//! ```text
//! cols       = bounds.width / char_height      // char HEIGHT as a column width
//! est_lines  = char_delta / cols
//! scroll_px  = est_lines * char_height
//! ```
//!
//! That is right only for a monospaced buffer with no wrapping, no images, no
//! variable-height rows, and a square cell. This computes the displacement
//! instead: find a row that appears in both presentations and take the
//! difference of its pixel positions.
