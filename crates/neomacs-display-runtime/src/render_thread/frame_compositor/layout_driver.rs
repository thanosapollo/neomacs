//! What the compositor is doing about the layout, as a state machine.
//!
//! This exists because the previous shape — an `Option<PaneLayoutMorph>` mutated
//! from ten places — produced four bugs of one kind. Each was a case nobody
//! wrote: a commit that changed no layout *cancelled* the motion; then, once
//! that was fixed, a commit that changed no layout *restarted* it, pinning
//! progress near zero so the panes crawled and never arrived; a leaving pane
//! repainted over the animation; and the compositor-only path discarded a
//! settled projection. None of them was a wrong decision — each was a decision
//! nobody was asked to make, because an `Option` plus scattered `if`s never
//! poses the question.
//!
//! Here the question is a `match`. Transitions consume `self` and return the
//! next state, so every (state, event) pair is a cell the compiler requires,
//! and a new state cannot be added without visiting each event that must handle
//! it.
//!
//! Two events drive it: a commit arriving from the evaluator, and a frame about
//! to be drawn. Nothing else may touch the motion.
