//! GPU device-loss detection for the render thread.
//!
//! A user shader with an infinite loop can hang the GPU
//! (`docs/display-engine/SHADER_SURFACES.md`: naga guarantees memory safety,
//! not termination). The driver then resets (TDR) and the wgpu device is
//! lost. Two signals feed one recovery decision:
//!
//! 1. wgpu's device-lost callback (`Device::set_device_lost_callback`),
//!    which may fire on any thread from inside wgpu's maintain paths, and
//! 2. a streak of consecutive `CurrentSurfaceTexture::Lost` acquisitions —
//!    some backends only report a reset through the swapchain.
//!
//! Both set one shared flag; `handle_about_to_wait` drains it and runs
//! `RenderApp::recover_from_device_loss`.
