//! The two strategies that actually run the glyph pipeline for a frame: draw
//! it into a composition-ring slot and place that slot, or draw it straight
//! onto the target view.
//!
//! Owns: the choice of *what happens to the composed picture* once it exists —
//! a whole-frame blit, a per-pane placement driven by the motion, the
//! transition draw layered over it — and the transition detection both
//! strategies run.
//!
//! Must not: decide which strategy applies, lease the slot, acquire or present
//! a surface. The draw order does all of that: a ring slot was already
//! requested and either granted or refused, and `None` means the frame is
//! degrading to the direct strategy — one frame without transitions or pane
//! motion, which is a real GPU-pressure outcome and not an error path.
//!
//! The two strategies differ in more than their target. The ring strategy
//! draws content *without* overlays, because the chrome has to land on the
//! placed result rather than inside the picture being placed; the direct
//! strategy draws content and overlays in one go. That asymmetry is the whole
//! reason `include_overlays` exists.
