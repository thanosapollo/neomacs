//! Everything drawn *over* the composed editor picture, in window
//! coordinates, and the order it goes on in.
//!
//! Owns: the sequence, and only the sequence. Two kinds of thing are drawn
//! here and they differ in what decides they exist:
//!
//! - `frame_bands` — the frame's own furniture. The custom titlebar, the menu
//!   / tool / compact bars and the rounded corner mask are there because the
//!   frame is configured that way, they occupy reserved geometry, and they do
//!   not animate.
//! - `transient_overlays` — the popup menu, the tooltip, the IME pre-edit box,
//!   the visual bell, the FPS readout and the typing-speed readout. Each is
//!   there because of something that just happened, and three of them are
//!   still moving while they are drawn.
//!
//! The two interleave, which is why neither half owns a run of the order: the
//! corner mask is a band and it goes on *after* the visual bell, because it
//! has to cut the corners out of the flash as well as out of the picture.
//! Later passes draw over earlier ones, so this sequence is load-bearing in
//! both directions and belongs in one file that does nothing else.
//!
//! Must not: decide *whether* the frame is drawn, acquire or present a
//! surface, or choose a composition strategy. This pass runs once the target
//! view is already chosen, and it draws onto whatever view it is handed —
//! the offscreen composition slot on a transition frame, the swapchain view
//! otherwise. It is the last content-producing phase of the draw order, which
//! is why the overlays that must keep animating report by setting the
//! frame-dirty flag rather than by scheduling anything themselves.
