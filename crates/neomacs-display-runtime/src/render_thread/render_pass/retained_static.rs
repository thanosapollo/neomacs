/// Whether this frame may be composed from the retained static scene:
/// the coordinator asked for a compositor-only cursor frame, and the scene is
/// eligible — no transition, no dynamic overlay, no pane motion, and every

/// ordinary full render. `NEOMACS_DISABLE_RETAINED_STATIC` force-disables it.
///
/// The transition test asks whether one is *active*, not whether the frame
/// needs an offscreen: the latter is true whenever crossfade/scroll
/// transitions are merely enabled (the default), because the offscreen
/// snapshot only has to be kept current across scene commits. A
/// compositor-only frame changes no editor content, so it cannot start a
/// transition, and the "before" snapshot captured at the last scene-commit
/// full render stays correct. Gating on "needs an offscreen" would disable
/// this path entirely under the default transition policy.
///
/// A pane morph disqualifies the frame for the same reason an active
/// transition does: the retained scene is a picture of the panes where the
/// *presentation* puts them, and a moving frame needs them where the motion
/// puts them. Reproducing it would snap every pane to its destination for
/// that frame and back on the next — a blink landing mid-motion is enough to
