//! Frame-scheduling evidence counters (Stage 0 of the frame scheduling plan,
//! docs/plans/2026-07-11-cross-platform-frame-scheduling-and-animation-architecture.md).
//!
//! Process-wide monotonic counters incremented from the render thread's
//! scheduling and presentation hot points. They change no policy; they exist
//! so scheduling changes can be judged by structural evidence (wakeups,
//! requests, commits, glyph-build passes, submissions, commit-to-submission
//! latency) instead of by CPU percentages alone.
//!
//! Historical `present` counter/field names measure queue submission and
//! commit-to-submission latency, not compositor-confirmed display. Keep these
//! diagnostic names compatible; native presentation receipts are separate.
//!
//! All counters are relaxed atomics: every writer runs on the render thread,
//! and readers only need eventually-consistent totals.
