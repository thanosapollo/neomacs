//! Pure frame scheduling: typed frame demand, per-window coalescing, and
//! pacing decisions.
//!
//! Stage 1 of the frame scheduling plan
//! (docs/plans/2026-07-11-cross-platform-frame-scheduling-and-animation-architecture.md).
//!
//! This module has no winit, wgpu, or wall-clock dependency. Every method
//! takes `now` (or a [`FrameTick`]) explicitly, so scheduling decisions are
//! deterministic under test: tests anchor one real `Instant` and derive all
//! other times by `Duration` arithmetic.
//!
//! Semantics:
//! - Demand is declared before drawing. Rendering consumes a [`FramePlan`];
//!   it never latches "render me again" as a side effect.
//! - At most one redraw request is outstanding per native window; duplicate
//!   driving demands coalesce into that request.
//! - Deadline demands ([`Cadence::At`], [`Cadence::MaxRate`]) are keyed by
//!   [`DemandReason`]: resubmitting replaces the previous entry, so a caller
//!   can declare its standing demand every pass without accumulation, and
//!   [`FrameCoordinator::retract`] withdraws a reason that no longer applies.
//! - [`Cadence::MaxRate`] keeps a per-reason phase anchor: consuming a tick
//!   advances the anchor by whole periods, so an interleaved one-shot frame
//!   (e.g. an editor commit) never re-anchors an ambient cadence.
//! - Ineligible (occluded/hidden) windows retain demand but are never asked
//!   to present; regaining eligibility issues exactly one recovery request.
