//! The one clipboard text policy: MIME preference, decoding, and absence
//! classification.
//!
//! Three backends can answer a text read — smithay-clipboard's `wl_data_device`
//! path, the `ext-data-control-v1` fallback, and arboard (X11 and the other
//! platforms) — and they must all answer it the same way.  This module owns
//! the parts of that answer we control:
//!
//! * which MIME spellings count as text and in what order (`TextMime::choose`,
//!   matching smithay-clipboard's `mime.rs::find_allowed`);
//! * how transferred bytes become a `String` (`TextMime::decode`, matching
//!   smithay-clipboard's `state.rs` post-processing);
//! * which native errors mean "nothing to paste" rather than failure
//!   (`classify_smithay`, `classify_arboard`);
//! * when the data-control fallback may answer for smithay
//!   (`text_or_fallback`).
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! It does not decode for smithay-clipboard or arboard.  Both pick and decode a
//! representation internally and hand back a `String` (arboard even decodes
//! X11's Latin-1 `STRING` atom), and smithay-clipboard never exposes the
//! offer's MIME list.  Their choice is dependency behaviour we cannot
//! intercept, so the policy classifies their outcomes instead.  The raw-bytes
//! decode path (the data-control reader) is the one this module fully owns; a
//! backend that receives bytes routes them through `choose`/`decode` here
//! rather than growing a fourth copy.
//!
//! Only the smithay-clipboard rows are Linux-gated.  `TextRead` and
//! `classify_arboard` serve every platform, because arboard is the X11, macOS,
//! and Windows backend alike and none of them needs a different text policy
//! today.
