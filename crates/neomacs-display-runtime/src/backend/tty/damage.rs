//! P3.5 stage B: terminal output that costs what changed.
//!
//! - **B1, silent frames** (`NEOMACS_TTY_SILENT=off|on`). A frame whose plan
//!   has no operation and whose cursor did not move writes nothing at all;
//!   GNU writes 0 bytes on an idle redisplay. A frame where only the cursor
//!   moved writes only the cursor motion, and the cursor shape is re-sent
//!   only when it changed (re-sending it resets the blink in several
//!   terminals).
//! - **B2, painter keys** (`NEOMACS_TTY_DAMAGE=off|verify|on`). Every grid
//!   row remembers, as [`PainterKey`]s, what painted it last frame: the face
//!   fills over it and the window-matrix rows written to it, each by
//!   identity (a `MatrixRow`'s `Arc` pointer, which the renderer keeps alive
//!   so it cannot be reused) plus placement. The frame-wide inputs (grid
//!   size, cell metrics, default colours, face-map generation, terminal
//!   capabilities) form a [`FrameKey`]. When the frame key is unchanged, a
//!   row whose key list is unchanged rasterizes to exactly the cells the
//!   screen model already holds, so a *damage frame* clears, paints, and
//!   plans only the other rows, through the same per-row planner the full
//!   path uses. Frame chrome bands and the rows under child frames carry no
//!   identity and are repainted every frame. Child frames, a layout scroll
//!   hint (`ReusedShifted` rows), a forced repaint, or damage over a quarter
//!   of the rows take the full path, which also runs scroll detection; there
//!   the old path's carry of `RowDamage::Reused` rows is limited to rows
//!   whose painters are unchanged. (The old path carries every reused row,
//!   except while child frames are drawn or were drawn last frame: a moved
//!   child's reused rows would be copied from what the screen held at the
//!   new place, and a closed child would stay on the parent's reused rows.)
//!
//!   Under `on` and `verify`, a full frame's scroll detection also reuses
//!   the screen model's row signatures (**B3**, [`RowSignatures`]): a row's
//!   hash and default-blank test are computed once when the row is planned
//!   and kept until an operation or a damage frame rewrites it, instead of
//!   rehashing every row of both grids each frame. Hashes only route scroll
//!   candidates (`verify_delta` compares the cells), so a stale signature
//!   could only cost a missed scroll, never a wrong screen.
//!
//!   `verify` runs the full path (whose output reaches the terminal) and
//!   the damage path on a copy of the renderer, and compares the screen
//!   models they leave: a row the damage path skipped whose content (cells
//!   other than their erased/written materialization) differs from the full
//!   path's is a false negative, a stale screen. It also counts rows the full
//!   path rewrote without changing their content (its materialization churn:
//!   a colored blank tail written as spaces is re-marked erasable every frame
//!   and so rewritten every frame; GNU leaves an unchanged row alone, as the
//!   damage path does), materialization-only differences, and frames whose
//!   bytes differ; see [`TtyDamageVerifyTotals`]. With
//!   `NEOMACS_TTY_DAMAGE_REPORT_FILE` set, every verified frame appends one
//!   line there.
//!
//! Every knob is read once per process, when the first [`TtyRif`] is built.
//!
//! | Knob | Unset default | Explicit baseline |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `NEOMACS_TTY_SILENT` | `on` | `off` |

//! | `NEOMACS_TTY_ROW_IDENTITY` | `appearance` | `address` or `off` |
//!
//! `on`/`1`/`true`/`yes` select the enabled path for each knob.
