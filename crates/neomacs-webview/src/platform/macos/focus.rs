//! GNU's macOS keyboard model for a web view, as data and decisions.
//!
//! `src/nsxwidget.m` (239-323, emacs-31.0.90) keeps keyboard events with
//! Emacs unless the page says an input element has focus, and lets `C-g`
//! typed into the page hand focus back.  The AppKit glue in `view.rs`
//! executes these decisions; this module holds what can be pinned without
//! AppKit: GNU's injected script, the message it listens for, and the pure
//! decisions, including the two this port adds at the native boundary (a
//! probe answer that is not a boolean, and a probe that completes after the
//! view's host changed).
//!
//! Not ported from GNU's `keyDown:` (nsxwidget.m:244-278): the
//! `isearch-mode` branch (:247-253, a buffer-local Lisp read the AppKit
//! thread cannot make; keys go to the page's focused input while searching)
//! and the `urlScriptBlocked` branch (:255-260, a response whose
//! `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` lacks `allow-scripts` sends every key
//! to Emacs without probing).  In such a document the probe itself fails and
//! `Failed` routes to Emacs, which converges on GNU's answer by accident,
//! not by port.
