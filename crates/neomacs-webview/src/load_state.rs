//! The one owner of a page's load state: milestones, observed readings,
//! deduplication and terminal ordering.
//!
//! A native browser reports the same load two ways.  Its navigation delegate
//! delivers discrete milestones (started, redirected, committed, finished),
//! and its observable properties (`title`, `URL`, `estimatedProgress` on
//! WKWebView; `DocumentTitle`/`Source` on WebView2) change continuously and
//! are read by a property observer or sampled once per service turn.  GNU
//! reads the three live when Lisp asks (`xwidget-webkit-estimated-load-
//! progress`, src/xwidget.c:3087-3110 and nsxwidget.m:374-378 in
//! emacs-31.0.90; `xwidget-webkit-title`, xwidget.c:3070-3085), polled by
//! `xwidget-webkit-callback`'s 0.5 s timer (lisp/xwidget.el:432-459), while
//! the `load-changed` phases arrive as events (xwidget.c:2427-2447).  This
//! port pushes progress, title and URI as events instead, so their
//! deduplication is its own responsibility.
//!
//! Two emitters of the same progress value drift: a finished load published
//! `1.0` from the milestone and again from the observer, and a failed load
//! could be followed by a lower sampled value.  [`PageLoadState`] is the
//! single writer.  Milestones and readings both go through it, each value is
//! reported once per change, and a progress reading is accepted only while a
//! load is in flight, so nothing follows the terminal `1.0` until the next
//! load starts.
