  "Insert SECTIONS of Org markup of the kind a real Org file carries.

The `org-editing' row builds headings, property drawers and tables and
nothing else, so its per-iteration `font-lock-ensure\' over the whole
buffer never reaches Org\'s expensive matchers: `org-activate-links\',
`org-do-emphasis-faces\' and `org-fontify-meta-lines-and-blocks\' have
nothing to match.  Measured against the Org manual (doc/misc/org.org,
23,370 lines), that fixture has 0 links, 0 emphasis markers, 0 `#+\'
lines, 0 list items and 0 timestamps per 100 lines where the manual has
2.3, 19.3, 15.5, 6.1 and 0.2 -- while carrying 15x the manual\'s table
rows and 6.6x its property drawers.

This emits the same 150 TODO headings and keeps a table in every section,
so the timed operation is unchanged and the two rows stay comparable.
What differs is everything around them: tags, a scheduled timestamp, a
paragraph carrying two links and three emphasis forms, a checkbox list
item, and a source block.  Cycled from constants and indexed by section,
so every machine builds a byte-identical document.

Every section carries every construct, which makes this an UPPER bound
rather than an average file.  Measured per 100 lines against the manual,
`#+\' lines (14.3 vs 15.5) and list items (7.1 vs 6.1) land where the
manual has them, while links (21.4 vs 2.3), emphasis (35.7 vs 19.3) and
timestamps (7.1 vs 0.2) run above it.  The plain row is the lower bound --
zero of all of them -- so a real file sits between the two rows, which is
the point of keeping both."
