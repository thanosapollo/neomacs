/// has been read, and those six are at least half of the source's samples at any
/// size — exactly half when its dimensions are multiples of eight, which is the

/// is a thousand pixels tall or a hundred thousand, where the same band of a
/// non-interlaced source costs `rows / height` and tends to nothing. A banded
/// decode would take as long to show half the picture as the whole-image path
/// takes to show all of it.
///
/// A one-row band is no way out either, which is the part that makes the
/// exclusion total rather than a matter of degree. A band has to fill whole
/// rows of the raster, and the first complete output row is spread across passes
/// 1, 2, 4 and 6 — three quarters of the passes between them — which are eleven
/// thirty-seconds of a multiple-of-eight source. One row of an interlaced
/// picture costs a third of the file; the same row of a non-interlaced one costs

///
/// Exposing the pass geometry would not rescue it either, which is the part an
