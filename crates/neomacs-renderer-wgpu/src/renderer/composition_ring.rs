//! The composed pictures of the last two frames, as values someone can hold.
//!
//! This replaces an `offscreen_a` / `offscreen_b` / `current_is_a` flip-flop
//! whose real contract was never written down anywhere: "after the flip, the
//! *other* texture still holds the previous frame's pixels". That contract is
//! exactly what a pool breaks if it hands back an arbitrary free slot, and it
//! is why a transition used to copy the whole previous frame into a third
//! texture on every start — a copy that existed only to pin pixels against
//! the next flip.
//!
//! A ring states the contract as ownership instead. `advance` *moves* the
//! current lease into `previous` and asks for a fresh slot for `current`, so
//! "the previous composition" is a value, and anything that needs it to
//! survive (a running crossfade, a departing pane) holds a clone. A held
//! slot's strong count is above one, so the pool declines to recycle it and
//! transparently allocates beside it: the copy is unnecessary and the
//! invariant cannot be lost by editing an index.
