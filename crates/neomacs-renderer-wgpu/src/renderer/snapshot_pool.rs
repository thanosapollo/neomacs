//! The single owner of every pooled full-frame GPU texture.
//!
//! # How a lease gets back to the pool
//!
//! A lease is an `Rc<Slot>`; the pool keeps one `Rc` per slot and hands out
//! clones. A slot is free exactly when `Rc::strong_count` is 1, which is to
//! say when the pool is the only holder. `Rc`'s own `Drop` is what returns a
//! lease, and [`SnapshotPool::acquire`] observes the result before it decides
//! anything — no `Drop` impl of our own, no generation counters, no return
//! queue.
//!
//! The two alternatives were both worse here:
//!
//! * An `Arc<Mutex<Pool>>` handle inside each lease lets `Drop` re-enter the
//!   pool directly, but a lease released while a render pass holds
//!   `&mut pool` deadlocks — and every release site in this codebase is
//!   inside such a pass. `Rc<RefCell<Pool>>` converts that deadlock into a
//!   panic, which is not an improvement.
//! * A generational slot index cannot notify the pool from `Drop` at all, so
//!   it needs a return queue anyway, and it replaces an ownership guarantee
//!   with a runtime "is this handle still valid" check. That is backwards:
//!   the illegal state should be unrepresentable, not detected.
//!
//! `Rc` is sound here because every one of these textures is created, read
//! and dropped on the render thread alone. `RenderApp` is built inside the
//! spawned render closure and only ever passed by `&mut` to
//! `event_loop.run_app`, which imposes no `Send` bound; the crate has no
//! `unsafe impl Send`, and the only worker threads (image decoders) carry CPU
//! pixel data and never a wgpu handle.
//!
//! # Why the use-after-free cannot happen
//!
//! A slot's wgpu objects live in the `Slot` behind the `Rc`, and the pool
//! only ever drops a slot whose strong count is 1. A slot any lease still
//! names therefore cannot be released, so a frame that holds a lease cannot
//! be sampling freed GPU memory. Handing out an arbitrary free slot is
//! likewise impossible for a slot someone holds — which is the property the
//! old `current_is_a` flip-flop got from an index invariant and this gets
//! from ownership.
//!
//! # Why the slot payload is a type parameter
//!
//! Only [`SnapshotResources`] is ever used in production. The parameter
//! exists so the pool's reuse, eviction and budget behaviour can be tested
//! with no GPU at all: this code is developed against a software rasterizer
//! where the whole offscreen path is forced off, and a test that skips when
//! no adapter is present proves nothing about the invariant it claims to
//! defend.
