//! Drawing one composed presentation with its panes somewhere other than
//! where the presentation puts them.
//!
//! Everything up to here produces a picture of the *destination*: the frame as
//! it will look once the layout change has settled. A pane morph does not
//! change that picture — it changes where each piece of it is drawn. So the
//! composed frame is rendered once into a texture and then blitted back one
//! pane at a time, each from the region of the picture the pane owns to the
//! rect the pane currently occupies.
//!
//! # Why not re-render per pane
//!
//! Re-running layout for each pane at each intermediate size would be both far
//! more expensive and *wrong*: it would reflow the text as the pane narrowed,
//! so the user would watch their lines rewrap dozens of times on the way to a
//! width they never asked to read at. Sampling one finished picture keeps the
//! text exactly as it will be when the motion ends; only its position moves.
//!
//! # Why the source region is anchored at the pane's destination origin
//!
//! A pane shows its destination content throughout the motion — that is what
//! makes the interaction projection a plain translation. So the region of the
//! composed picture it samples starts at its *destination* origin, extends by
//! its *current* size, and is drawn into its *current* rect at natural scale.
//! Stretching destination-sized content to fit would resample the glyphs and
//! read as a zoom.
//!
//! One consequence is worth naming, because it looks like a bug and is not.
//! A pane still larger than its destination samples past its destination edge,
//! into the region the picture gives to whatever sits there — its new
//! neighbour, or the mode line and echo area below. As the pane's quad narrows
//! toward its final size, that borrowed strip narrows with it and the real
//! neighbour is uncovered underneath. The result reads as the old window
//! shrinking to reveal the new one, which is what a split looks like, and it
//! is why the quad itself is the clip: there is nothing to draw outside it.
