//! One ceiling for every full-frame GPU texture the render thread owns.
//!
//! Five kinds of full-frame texture used to be created in four files and
//! freed only on device loss or resize, so "how much VRAM does a frame window
//! cost" had no answer to give. A limit on its own would not have produced
//! one either: the pooled textures are a minority of the bytes. Five
//! full-frame textures at 2560x1440 are about 59 MB, while a single window's
//! glyph atlas can reach 288 MB (8 pages of 2048² across three materials), so
//! a ceiling that saw only the pool would constrain the wrong thing.
//!
//! The budget therefore has two sides, and they differ in how much they can
//! be trusted:
//!
//! * `pooled_bytes` is exact by construction. Only [`SnapshotPool`] moves it,
//!   and a pooled texture cannot be allocated or released anywhere else.
//! * `unpooled_bytes` is a census. It covers full-frame GPU objects whose
//!   owning structs cannot hold a lease, so they report their size instead.
//!   The render pass re-reports each frame window's entries from live state
//!   once per frame, which is what keeps a census from drifting: a texture
//!   that was freed reports zero on the next frame rather than staying charged
//!   forever.
//!
//! The renderer's own stencil clip target is the one census entry that is not
//! re-reported per frame, because it does not need to be: it has a single
//! allocation site, `WgpuRenderer::install_stencil_targets`, which charges it
//! in the same statement that replaces it. Set semantics do the rest — there
//! is nothing for a re-report to correct.
//!
//! [`SnapshotPool`]: super::snapshot_pool::SnapshotPool
