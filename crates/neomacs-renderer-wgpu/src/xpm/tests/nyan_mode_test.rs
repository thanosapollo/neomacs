//! The issue's upstream artwork, fetched at test time rather than vendored.
//!
//! `nyan.xpm` is TeMPOraL/nyan-mode's, so a copy in this tree would be a fork
//! of it: the pin is the URL plus the SHA-256, and `neomacs-infra`'s
//! `pinned_file` verifies the bytes on every use. The report's claim was that
//! "gray details turn black" in this file, and its palette is where the
//! ladder lives -- fourteen `grayNN` names, nine of which the pixel data paints.
