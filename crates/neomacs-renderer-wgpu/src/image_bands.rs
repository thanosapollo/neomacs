//! Row-wise decode, for sources whose decoder can hand back part of a frame.
//!
//! A large image takes long enough to decode that the honest thing to do with
//! it is to show it arriving: rows become available from the top while the
//! bottom is still being read. [`BandSource`] is the route decision — a
//! row-wise decoder, or the all-or-nothing decode this renderer did before —
//! and [`BandedSource::next_band`] is the progress itself.
//!
//! Four properties this module is built to keep:
//!
//! - **Bands tile the source.** A source derives every band from the cursor it
//!   advances itself, and nothing can ask a source for a named range, so its
//!   bands cannot overlap, skip or arrive out of order.
//! - **A banded decode agrees with the whole one.** Both decode through the
//!   same transforms and both land in the same RGBA, which is what lets a
//!   decode move between the two paths without the picture changing.
//! - **Failure is not truncation.** A row-wise decode that errors mid-stream
//!   stops at [`BandStep::Failed`]; its bands are abandoned and the caller
//!   decodes the whole image again. Only [`BandedSource::into_raster`] on a
//!   completed source yields pixels.
//! - **A band knows where it goes, and its pixels are already there.** The
//!   decode writes into the raster its texture holds
//!   ([`crate::image_scale::RasterTarget`]) rather than into a native-size image
//!   it would later have to resample, so a band is a range of the raster with
//!   the pixels for it, and a source that reaches the end hands back that same
//!   raster — the preview during a decode and the finished image are one
//!   buffer, not two that have to agree.
