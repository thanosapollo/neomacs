//! Central grapheme-cluster composition rules for the layout walks.
//!
//! GNU Emacs groups characters into composed grapheme clusters via its
//! automatic-composition machinery, carrying a `struct composition_it`
//! (src/dispextern.h) on the display iterator so every text-producing path
//! groups clusters identically. neomacs's layout walks historically each
//! made their own ad-hoc `is_cluster_extender` checks; this module is the
//! single source of truth they share.
//!
//! Phase 2 covers grapheme clusters (combining marks, variation selectors,
//! ZWJ emoji sequences, regional-indicator flag pairs) — the cases GNU
//! composes by default. Contextual-shaping scripts (Arabic, Indic) and the
//! glyph-id gstring arrive in a later phase.
