//! Row acquisition routing for the buffer-source migration.
//!
//! GNU has ONE iterator (`struct it`, xdisp.c) and `next_element_from_buffer`
//! is simply a method on it; neomacs still has two row paths — the buffer
//! pipeline (this module's siblings) and the unified item renderer
//! (`display_row/`, driven by `DisplayItemSource`). This module is the seam
//! that migrates the simplest buffer row class onto the item renderer:
//!
//! * [`RowAcquisitionRoute`] + [`classify_row_acquisition`] decide, at the
//!   start of a buffer line, whether the row is plain enough for the item
//!   renderer. "Plain" mirrors what makes GNU `get_next_display_element`
//!   trivial: TAB plus printable characters the shared width table sizes at
//!   exactly 1 or 2 columns — ASCII since increment 1, and since increment 2b
//!   any printable non-ASCII char of unambiguous width, so CJK and Latin
//!   accents route while contextual-shaping scripts, regional indicators and
//!   nobreak chars refuse (see [`classify_routed_row_char`], which states the
//!   full ladder). Also required: no display/mouse-face/line-height
//!   properties in range and no display table. Direction is NOT a condition:
//!   RTL and mixed rows route, because bidi reordering is a row-level install
//!   step below this seam (`GlyphRowFinalizer::finalize` ->
//!   `reorder_row_bidi`), so both producers emit the same logical-order row
//!   and the same pure permutation makes it visual
//!   (`classifier_routes_hebrew_rtl_rows`). Either the whole line fits
//!   without
//!   continuation or truncation and ends in a real newline, or — phase 2f —
//!   the line overflows and the route covers only its maximal fitting
//!   prefix, handing the walk back to the pipeline at the first char that
//!   does not fit so the pipeline's own overflow machinery (truncation skip
//!   / continuation transition, row flags, carry-over bookkeeping) decides
//!   wrap-vs-truncate unchanged. Since P4.8 the route attempts EVERY walk
//!   position, line start or mid-line alike: a candidate classifies from
//!   its own charpos and the loop's live pen, so the continuation rows of a
//!   visually wrapped line, and the resumes after a display element, all
//!   route the same way a line start does. Composition refuses through the
//!   pipeline's OWN predicates (phase 2e): a char the shared writer would
//!   compose into the previous glyph (`composition::continues_cluster` /
//!   `continues_complex_run` over the scan's mirror of the row tail) and a
//!   static `composition` text property the pipeline's replacement
//!   predicate parses (`composition_display_text_for_property`) both keep
//!   the buffer pipeline; an inert composition prop renders literally and
//!   routes.
//!   FACE-affecting properties (`face`, `font-lock-face`, `fontified`
//!   boundaries) are allowed: they segment the row at property-change
//!   positions exactly like GNU `compute_stop_pos` bounds the iterator's
//!   text runs and `handle_face_prop` re-resolves the face at each stop.
//!   Overlays intersecting the row are allowed when they carry ONLY
//!   face-affecting properties ([`ROUTE_SAFE_OVERLAY_PROPS`]): their faces
//!   merge through the same checkpoint resolver seam (GNU
//!   `face_at_buffer_position`'s ascending-priority overlay loop) and their
//!   starts/ends segment the row like GNU `next_overlay_change` folded into
//!   `compute_stop_pos`. Overlay before/after-strings ROUTE since P4.6
//!   sub-step 3b (the increment 2i rung 4 refusal is retired). Its recorded
//!   reason — "overlay strings are INSERTIONS driven by the walk's own
//!   overlay machinery, and unlike the replacement session there is no
//!   single typed request the routed commit can drive without replicating
//!   that walk state" — stopped being true in two independent ways.
//!   Loading and GNU ordering moved OUT of the walk and into the producer
//!   (P4.6 sub-step 1), which surfaces them as one typed insertion element;

//!   and `render_produced_strings_at_text_row` takes exactly the loop state
//!   the routed commit already owns, `overlay_context` included. So the
//!   routed commit DELEGATES — the same call `render.rs`'s loop-level arm
//!   makes — and what stays refused is only what the routed row shape
//!   genuinely cannot express: an anchor at the row start (the loop's route
//!   attempt runs BEFORE the pipeline step that would emit it, so routing
//!   would drop the string), an anchor at the coverage end (the line end and
//!   the overflow handoff char belong to the pipeline's own lifecycle), a
//!   string outside the routable Lisp-string class, and any anchor on an
//!   overflow-prefix plan (the append session clips and breaks rows itself,
//!   so the scan's handoff cut is not the pipeline's overflow point — the
//!   same reason replacement rows never route as overflow prefixes).
//!   Plain-elision `invisible` text (phase 2d) is expressible: hidden spans
//!   simply drop chars, so the routed source emits visible-segment TextRuns
//!   whose charpos bookkeeping jumps the gap, exactly like the pipeline's
//!   invisible checkpoint `skip_chars_until` (GNU `handle_invisible_prop`
//!   advancing `IT_CHARPOS`). The inexpressible invisible sub-cases refuse:
//!   ellipsis (inserts `...` glyphs with their own face/provenance rules),
//!   runs covering the newline (line-structure change), row-start runs
//!   (consumed by the loop checkpoint before the route), overlay-sourced
//!   invisibility (2c allow-list). `display` replacements route since
//!   increment 2i for the narrow routable class — a plain property-less
//!   single-line string (rung 2) or a plain `(space :width N)` spec
//!   (rung 3) anchored strictly inside the line — by rendering through the
//!   pipeline's OWN replacement session at commit (typed string-index glyph
//!   provenance plus covered buffer range, string base-face policy, session
//!   walk bookkeeping); every
//!   other display shape refuses through [`routed_row_replacement_scan`].
//! * [`BufferPlainItemSource`] is the `DisplayItemSource` for such a row: it
//!   produces exactly the items `BufferTextSourceCursor` would — one plain
//!   `TextRun` per face segment (one for the whole line when no property
//!   changes in range), then the explicit-newline row break.
//!
//! Rows carrying point are deliberately excluded: cursor capture is a
//! documented buffer-pipeline responsibility (see the cursor-capture note in
//! `row_lifecycle.rs`), mirroring GNU `set_cursor_from_row` operating on
//! buffer positions only.
