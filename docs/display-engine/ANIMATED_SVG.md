# Animated SVG (computed animation)

Status: implemented — elisp-driven increment. Render-paced driving is the
declared follow-up (see "Pacing" below).

GNU Emacs renders SVG through librsvg, which has no document clock: an
animated SVG displays as one static frame and `image-multi-frame-p`
returns nil. Neomacs can instead *compute* the frames an SVG's SMIL
timeline defines, expose them through the same machinery as GIF frames,
and let everything downstream (`image-animate`, `:index`, the sequence
cache budget) work unmodified. Because that changes observable behavior,
it is strictly opt-in per image spec.

## The gate

The `:animation` image-spec property (a Neomacs extension; GNU has no such
key):

```elisp
;; static, GNU-identical (the default, also for absent/nil/zero values)
(list 'image :type 'svg :data svg-text)

;; materialize frames at the default 30 fps sampling ceiling
(list 'image :type 'svg :data svg-text :animation t)

;; materialize with an explicit ceiling — also the frame-count bound
(list 'image :type 'svg :data svg-text :animation 12)
```

`neomacs-svg-animation` is the defcustom default packages can spread in
(`neomacs-image-spec-add-animation`). Oracle parity runs never set it:
the disabled policy is the parity boundary, pinned by
`divergence/image_svg_animation.rs`.

## Architecture

Three concerns, strictly separated:

1. **Timeline model** (`neomacs-renderer-wgpu/src/svg_animation/plan.rs`) —
   the document's animation elements compiled once into pure data: byte
   sites in the source text, parsed keyframe values, timing. Nothing
   re-parses the document per frame.
2. **Evaluation** (`eval.rs`) — pure `(plan, document time) → attribute
   values`. No clocks, no I/O; unit-tested as data in, data out.
3. **Sampling** (`sampler.rs` + `patch.rs`) — a
   `display_protocol::animated_visual::SampleGrid` quantizes the loop;
   each slot is evaluated, byte-spliced into the source, and rasterized
   through the ordinary `svg.rs` path, producing frames shaped exactly
   like decoded GIF frames (dimensions + exact rational delay).

Frames are published through the image sequence cache
(`image_sequence.rs::resolve_svg`), so computed animation shares the
64 MiB sequence budget, LRU eviction, and retirement fencing with authored
animation. `MediaClock` (display-protocol) is the presentation-time ⇄
document-time mapping the pacing increment will drive.

### The SMIL subset

`<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`, `<set>` with `from`/`to`/`values`,
`dur`, `begin` offsets, `repeatCount`, `fill`, `calcMode`
`linear`/`discrete` (spline/paced degrade to linear), `keyTimes`, and
targets by parent or `href`. Anything outside the subset drops its rule —
unsupported animation degrades toward the static frame, never a failed
load.

### Bounds

- `period × fps` slots maximum, hard-capped at `SampleGrid::MAX_SLOTS`
  (256); the fps ceiling is therefore a memory bound as much as a rate.
- Per-frame raster is bounded by the ordinary SVG caps (8 MiB input,
  64 MiB raster).
- Sampling happens on the background decode pool, like every other
  decode.

### Sharing rules

Sequence identity follows the resolve source. Cache entries carry a typed
materialization: authored raster, or computed SVG with its sampling policy,
face colors and resource context. A hit requires all materialization inputs
to match. Policy-off requests never use computed frames, and enabled requests
with different FPS ceilings get their own frame count and delay. One variant
per source is resident at a time under the shared byte budget; alternating
variants may recompute. Concurrent identical misses return the published
winner, including its pixels and metadata. Decode leases release retirement
accounting during success, failure and panic unwinding.

Finite spans include an exact terminal sample (freeze or restore the base),
with room reserved inside the 256-frame cap. Repeating spans preserve a
one-time introductory prefix, followed by the checked least common multiple
of indefinite durations after finite effects settle. The `loop-start`
metadata tells the timer adapter where the repeating tail begins;
`intro-delay` and `loop-delay` preserve both spans under the total frame cap.
Unrepresentable spans fall back to static.

## Threading

The evaluator (elisp VM) thread participates only at image load and
retirement, exactly as for GIF: a spec resolves, a load command carries
the policy, the decode pool materializes frames. In this increment frame
*advancement* is driven by `image-animate`'s timer walking `:index` —
GNU's own mechanism, and what neomacs uses for GIF today.

**The follow-up increment** moves advancement to the render thread: a
per-sequence `MediaClock` (epoch at first presentation, paused while
unpresented), frame indices derived from presentation time on the
scheduler's phase-anchored grid, and a new `DemandReason` cadence
(`AnimatedImage`) declaring `Cadence::At`/`MaxRate` from the plan's
`AnimatedVisual` answers (already implemented on `AnimationPlan`). The
scheduler and layer design (`frame_sched.rs`, `LayerMask::MEDIA`) needs
no changes for that — the vocabulary exists. Until then, the elisp path
is the driving mechanism, and the VM-thread cost is one load command per
frame change while animating (identical to GIF under `image-animate`).
